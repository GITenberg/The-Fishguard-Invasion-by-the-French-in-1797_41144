9</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>The very curious incident related in the following narrative
took place nearly a hundred years ago, and, as men&rsquo;s
memories are short, and the whole affair reads like
fiction&mdash;and very improbable and imaginative
fiction&mdash;it may be as well to write a few lines of
introduction, and to give my authorities for the facts mentioned
in the story.</p>
<p>In the first place, the evidence of persons who had witnessed
the landing, and who recollected it perfectly, and who have told
the story to me&mdash;I have met many such <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>in the course
of my life, as my home was within sight of Fishguard Head.&nbsp;
Probably the last of these eye-witnesses was the old woman who
died a short time ago&mdash;on February 8, 1891.&nbsp; Her demise
was announced by the Pembrokeshire papers as &ldquo;The Death of
a Pembrokeshire Centenarian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The death occurred on Sunday morning at the Dyffryn Cottages,
near Fishguard, of Eleanor (Nelly) Phillips at the age of
103.&nbsp; Her age is pretty accurately fixed by a statement she
was wont to make, that she was nine years old when the French
landed at Fishguard.&nbsp; She was a spinster, and had been
bedridden for eight years.&nbsp; When a mere girl she was in
service at Kilshawe, near Fishguard, and was driving cows from a
field when the French frigates appeared off the coast in
1797.</p>
<p>In the second place, the following books and
pamphlets:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Fenton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pembrokeshire,&rdquo; pp. 10, 11,
and 12.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Book of South Wales,&rdquo; by C. F. Cliffe, p.
251.</p>
<p>A curious and scarce pamphlet, written by Williams of
Crachenllwyd, a place near St. David&rsquo;s; he was the farmer
who sent his servant to give the alarm.&nbsp; The pamphlet was
called &ldquo;The Landing of the French,&rdquo; and was, I
believe, printed at Haverfordwest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Dragon,&rdquo; 1885.&nbsp; <i>Western Mail</i>
Office, Cardiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Authentic Account of the Invasion of the French
Troops (under the command of General Tate) on Carrig Gwasted
Point, near Fishguard, Wednesday, the 22nd day of February, 1797,
and their Surrender to the Forces of His Britannic Majesty on
Goodwick Sands, on Friday, the 24th of February; likewise some
occurrences <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>connected therewith: never before published.&nbsp;
Haverfordwest: Joseph Potter, printer, High Street,
1842.&rdquo;&nbsp; This pamphlet was written by H. L. ap
Gwilym&mdash;and was signed as correct by two eye-witnesses,
Fishguard Fencible men, Peter Davies and Owen Griffith.</p>
<p>Laws, &ldquo;Little England beyond Wales,&rdquo; p. 367.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Leach, the editor of the
<i>Tenby Observer</i>, for many particulars, and especially for
information as to how the news was conveyed to England.&nbsp; He
found the following entry in the overseer&rsquo;s accounts for
the borough of Tenby:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Thursday</i>, <i>Feb.</i> 23,
1797.&nbsp; Cash paid by Mr. Mayor&rsquo;s order to John Upcoat,
for going out to the Road for a skiff to go over to the English
side to give information concerning the landing of about 1,400
French Troops at <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Fishguard in the County, who on the next day surrendered
themselves up to the Welsh etc., that went to oppose them as
<i>prisoners of war</i>, and were marched accordingly by Saturday
25th to Haverfordwest. . . 1s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This entry could not have been entirely made on Feb. 23rd,
unless the worthy overseer had the gift of prophecy.</p>
<p>The messenger probably came on to Tenby from Stackpole, where
he aroused Lord Cawdor with the tidings in the middle of
Wednesday night.&nbsp; The news conveyed by John Upcoat must have
been taken across the Channel to Somersetshire and thence to
London; the manner of proceeding at the <i>fin de
si&egrave;cle</i> of the eighteenth century contrasts amusingly
with the rapidity of the nineteenth, but possibly our time will
be scoffed at and considered slow by the twentieth.</p>
<p>The <i>European Magazine</i> of the period <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>gives the
names of the vessels: <i>La R&eacute;sistance</i>, commanded by
Monsieur Montague, 40 guns, eighteen pounders on her main deck,
345 men.&nbsp; The other frigate <i>La Constance</i>, commanded
by Monsieur Desauny, mounted 24 nine-pounders on her main deck,
with 189 men. <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p>One of the frigates and the corvette were eventually captured
off Brest by the <i>St. Fiorenzo</i> frigate (Captain Sir H. B.
Neale, Bart.) and the <i>La Nymphe</i> (Captain J. Cooke), who
took them both into Portsmouth, where the frigate was repaired
and rechristened the <i>Fisgard</i>, presumably the French
pronunciation of Fishguard, and was until quite lately the
receiving ship at Sheerness.&nbsp; The other frigate and the
lugger managed to get safely into Brest.</p>
<p>The officers present at the council of war held at the
&ldquo;Royal Oak,&rdquo; Fishguard, were <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the
Lord-Lieutenant of the county, Lord Milford (who from age and
infirmity had given up the command of the troops to Lord Cawdor),
Lord Cawdor, Colonel Knox, Colonel Colby, Major Ackland, Colonel
Dan. Vaughan, Colonel James, Colonel George Vaughan, the governor
of Fishguard Fort, and other gentlemen.&nbsp; The troops
consisted of the Castle Martin Yeomanry Cavalry, the
Cardiganshire Militia, the Cardiff Militia (which was then
stationed in Pembrokeshire), some Fencible infantry, and a few
sailors under Lieutenants Mears and Perkins, in all 750 men.</p>
<p>The letters that passed between General Tate and Lord Cawdor
are given in the narrative, but the following letters from Lord
Milford and Lord Cawdor to the Duke of Portland, Secretary of
State for the Home Department, may be found
interesting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span><i>From Lord
Milford</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Haverfordwest</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>February</i> 26, 1797, Six
o&rsquo;clock <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I had the honour of writing last to your Grace by
express I received information of the French ships having sailed
and left 300 men behind, who have surrendered themselves
prisoners.&nbsp; The great spirit and loyalty that the gentlemen
and peasantry has shown on this occasion exceeds
description.&nbsp; Many thousands of the latter assembled, armed
with pikes and scythes, and attacked the enemy previous to the
arrival of troops that were sent against them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Haverfordwest</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>February</i> 24, Nine
o&rsquo;clock <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the honour and pleasure to inform your Grace
that the whole of the French troops, amounting to near fourteen
hundred men, have surrendered, and are now <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>on their
march to Haverfordwest.&nbsp; I have taken the first opportunity
of announcing the good news to your Grace, and shall have the
honour of writing again to your Grace by tomorrow&rsquo;s
post.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following letter was written by Lord Cawdor to the Duke of
Portland:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fishguard</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Friday</i>,
<i>February</i> 24, 1797.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;In
consequence of having received information on Wednesday night, at
eleven o&rsquo;clock, that three large ships of war and a lugger
had anchored in a small roadstead upon the coast, in the
neighbourhood of this town, I proceeded immediately with a
detachment of the Cardiganshire Militia and all the provincial
force I could collect to the place.&nbsp; I soon gained positive
intelligence they had disembarked about 1,200 men, but no
cannon.&nbsp; Upon the night setting in <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>a French
officer, whom I found to be second in command, came in with a
letter (a copy of which I sent your Grace, together with my
answer), <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a> in consequence of which they determined
to surrender themselves prisoners of war, and, accordingly, laid
down their arms this day at two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I cannot, at
this moment, inform your Grace the exact number of prisoners, but
I believe it to be their whole force.&nbsp; It is my intention to
march them this night to Haverfordwest, where I shall make the
best distribution in my power.&nbsp; The frigates, corvette, and
lugger got under weigh yesterday evening, and were this morning
entirely out of sight.&nbsp; The fatigue we experienced will, I
trust, excuse me to your Grace for not giving a more particular
detail; but my anxiety to do justice to the officers and men I
had the honour to command, will induce me to <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>attend your
Grace with as little delay as possible, to state their merits
and, at the same time, to give you every information in my power
on this subject.&nbsp; The spirit and loyalty which has pervaded
all ranks throughout the country is infinitely beyond what I can
express.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am, &amp;c.,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cawdor</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p20.jpg">
<img alt=

src="images/p20.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Lord Cawdor&rsquo;s &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; took the form
of placing 700 men in the beautiful old church of St.
Mary&rsquo;s (which they greatly injured), 500 in the Town Hall,
and the remainder in the store-houses of Haverfordwest.&nbsp; The
officers were allowed out on parole, and one of them showed scant
respect for his word of honour, for he was discovered at a
silversmith&rsquo;s trying to barter an old silver cup for coin
of the realm, with which doubtless to escape to France.&nbsp;
There <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>were
some letters on the cup which he chose to decipher as &ldquo;La
Vend&eacute;e&rdquo;; they turned out on inspection to be
&ldquo;Llanwnda,&rdquo; from which church the chalice had been
stolen, and where it was at once returned, while the officer was
transferred from the &ldquo;Castle Hotel&rdquo; to the Castle
jail&mdash;a very different place.</p>
<p>A number of the prisoners were shortly after sent on to
Carmarthen and to Pembroke, where the romantic episode of the
escape from the Golden Prison occurred exactly as given in the
narrative.&nbsp; The arms and ammunition taken from the French
filled fifty-five carts; their muskets were the ordinary weapon
of the period, with flint locks, barrels 3ft. 7in., whole length
4ft. 10in., weight 9&frac34;lbs.&nbsp; Lord Cawdor presented two
of these muskets to the Tenby Museum, and Mr. Mathias gave a
short sword and scabbard.&nbsp; On each side of the sword are <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>represented
sun, moon, and stars, with the inscription <i>Cassaguard</i>,
<i>Fourbisseur du Roy</i>, <i>Nantes</i>.&nbsp; There are
half-a-dozen cannonballs&mdash;nine pounders&mdash;at the house
of Eleanor Rees, of Goodwick, which were given to her father by
the French&mdash;a curious toy for a small boy of two or three
years of age.&nbsp; The invaders seem to have been very kind to
this young Taffy, nursed him on their knees, and made much of
him, and finally presented him with this strange <i>gage
d&rsquo;amour</i>.&nbsp; He was probably a plucky little fellow,
for he grew into a brave man, and was awarded a medal for having
at various times saved many lives, going out in his own boat to
shipwrecked vessels and rescuing the crews&mdash;when the <i>Lady
Kenmare</i> foundered he saved, among others, two ladies and some
children, bringing them through a tremendous sea, &ldquo;in their
night-dresses, as wet as sops,&rdquo; the narrator added.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Most of
the prisoners were finally sent back to France, when it was
discovered what manner of men they were.&nbsp; Lord Cawdor took
General Tate and some of the other officers to London, whence
they were consigned to Dartmoor.&nbsp; This personally-conducted
journey through England was not without peril.&nbsp; The people
were greatly incensed against the French, and were quite ready to
carry out Lynch law on these unhappy men, and in the excitement
of the moment a mob does not always discriminate between its
friends and its foes.&nbsp; It was fortunate for Tate and his
fellows, and still more fortunate for Pembrokeshire, that the
conduct of the whole affair from first to last was in such able
and determined hands as those of Lord Cawdor.&nbsp; A letter from
him to Lady Cawdor (hitherto unpublished, and for which I am
indebted to Mr. Laws), gives a very vivid account of this
journey.</p>

time free from interruption to give you a short account of our
employment, etc., since I quitted you, but shall reserve much of
the detail for your amusement when we meet, a moment I ardently
long for.&nbsp; Near Tavern Spite I met a messenger, with the D.
of Portland&rsquo;s despatches to me signifying the King&rsquo;s
approbation of my conduct, which probably General Rooke has shown
you, accompanied also by a handsome and flattering private letter
from the Duke.&nbsp; Upon my arrival at Carmarthen I immediately
sent off the messenger with my letters, and finding the
impossibility of procuring horses until the following morn was in
the expectation of getting a quiet night, having procured a bed
at a private house; but an alarm of a fire in the town joined to
confusion created <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>by the report of a landing in great force in
Glamorganshire, which I knew must have no foundation, prevented
my obtaining sleep for one moment.&nbsp; Early in the morn we
left Carmarthen, with three chaises; in the first, Joe Adams had
charge of Tate and Captain Tyrell, the first alarmed and
confused, the second a stupid Paddy.&nbsp; I had Le Brun with me,
as dirty as a pig, but more intelligent and better manners; in
the last, Lord E. Somerset had the care of Captain Norris and
Lieutenant St. Leger, both greatly frightened, they had but
little conversation.&nbsp; The whole road we passed through great
crowds of people at all the places were (<i>sic</i>) we changed
horses, and thro&rsquo; Wales tho&rsquo; the indignation of the
people was great, I found my influence would protect them without
difficulty.&nbsp; The women were more clamorous than the men,
making signs to cut their throats, and desiring I would not take
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the
trouble of carrying them further.&nbsp; All the military
assistance I could get at Oxford as a guard for the night was a
sergeant of your friend and landlord, and two recruits, but I had
no apprehension of their escape as their remain (<i>sic</i>) with
us was the only thing that ensured their safety.&nbsp; At
Uxbridge the rage of the mob was chiefly directed against Tate,
who was supposed to be Wall, and he trembled almost to
convulsions, by a little arrangement I contrived to bring them
quiet through the parks, and lodged them in the Duke of
Portland&rsquo;s before any crowd was assembled.&nbsp; My time
since that moment has been taken up with attendance at the
different offices, etc., and ministers are so bewildered by the
difficulties at the Bank, etc., that it is more than usually
difficult to get access to them for any time, but I have seen
them all and stated to them plainly and decidedly, the situation
of Pembroke, etc., <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>giving every testimony in my power.&nbsp; The weather is
extremely cold, the town I hear dull and unpleasant, everybody I
have seen much interested about you, Mrs. Wodehouse . . . and
desires her love.&nbsp; Joe his respects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having disposed of the rank and file of the expedition, there
comes the natural question, what was its <i>raison
d&rsquo;&eacute;tre</i>?&nbsp; Some persons think it was merely a
fine stroke of political economy on the part of the French
Government, for a considerable number of the men were convicts,
and to have them killed or imprisoned at the expense of the
English would undoubtedly have been a good financial arrangement;
but the biography of Lazare Hoche <a name="citation26"></a><a
href="#footnote26" class="citation">[26]</a> proves that a much
larger idea than this was in the mind <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>of the originator of the
invasion.&nbsp; He was a successful general and an ambitious man,
and his imagination was fired by the prowess of
Napoleon:&mdash;&ldquo;La France couvrait alors ses
fronti&egrave;res de jeunes r&eacute;publiques, et Bonaparte
saisissait les imaginations par ses merveilleux exploits en
Italie.&nbsp; Hoche, retenu par les p&eacute;nibles soins de la
pacification de l&rsquo;Ouest, avait suivi de son ardente
pens&eacute;e le vainqueur d&rsquo;Arcole &agrave; travers, tous
ses champs de victoire: &lsquo;Glorieux jeune homme,
s&rsquo;&eacute;criait-il en se frappant le front,&rsquo; que je
te porte envie!&nbsp; Il br&ucirc;lait de faire d&rsquo;aussi
grandes choses, et de trouver un champ de gloire digne de son
g&eacute;nie; il projetait donc de r&eacute;volutionner
l&rsquo;Irlande, de la transformer en r&eacute;publique; puis de
passer en Angleterre et de la frapper au c&oelig;ur.&nbsp; Il fit
adopter son projet par le gouvernement qui, apr&ecirc;s
s&rsquo;&ecirc;tre concert&eacute; avec les chefs des
r&eacute;volutionnaires irlandais, pr&eacute;para &agrave; Brest
une grande exp&eacute;dition dont <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Hoche eut le commandement. . . Hoche
y joignit deux l&eacute;gions, qu&rsquo;il nomma l&eacute;gions
des Francs: il composa la premi&egrave;re des officiers et des
soldats les plus r&eacute;solus, audacieux jusqu&rsquo; &agrave;
la t&eacute;m&eacute;rit&eacute;; il forma la seconde, il faut le
dire, d&rsquo;&eacute;l&eacute;ments indignes, et c&rsquo;est un
reproche pour sa m&eacute;moire.&nbsp; D&eacute;testant
l&rsquo;Angleterre, partageant de tristes prejuj&eacute;s et
regardant, en haine du gouvernement britannique, le peuple
anglais comme le supp&ocirc;t de ministres perfides et
d&rsquo;une odieuse aristocratie, tous les moyens lui semblaient
permis pour abaisser et pour d&eacute;soler cette fi&egrave;re
nation: il agit en cons&eacute;quence et fit entrer dans cette
seconde l&eacute;gion tout ce qu&rsquo;il put ramasser de gens
perdus, de bandits et de massacreurs, et il la mit sous le
commandement d&rsquo;un chef &eacute;tranger connu par sa sauvage
&eacute;nergie.&nbsp; Cette l&eacute;gion devait aborder en
Angleterre pour abuser l&rsquo;ennemi sur la v&eacute;ritable
destination de l&rsquo;escadre portant le corps <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

d&eacute;barquer &agrave; l&rsquo;embouchure de la Saverne, de se
porter de nuit sur Bristol, d&rsquo;incendier cette ville et de
semer la devastation dans les campagnes environnantes; puis de se
rembarquer pour jeter plusieurs d&eacute;tachements sur
diff&eacute;rents points du littoral en portant partout la mort,
le ravage et l&rsquo;incendie, attirant ainsi sur elle et
retenant en Angleterre une partie consid&eacute;rable des forces
britanniques, tandis que l&rsquo;exp&eacute;dition cinglerait
viers la c&ocirc;te irlandaise.&rdquo;</p>

Hoche compiled his instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. Laws has kindly shown me an &ldquo;Authentic Copy of the
Instructions given by General Hoche to the American officer,
Colonel Tate, who commanded the men employed in the French
Invasion of South Wales in 1797.&rdquo;&nbsp; It commences
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There will be placed under the command of
Colonel Tate a body of troops completely organised to the number
of one thousand and fifty, all resolute, determined men, with
whom he may undertake anything.&nbsp; They are to be called
&lsquo;La Seconde L&eacute;gion des Francs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The legion is completely armed; he will <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>be likewise
furnished with fast-going vessels with which he is to proceed
before, with, or after the squadron; the vessels will be
victualled for the passage, but the legion will bring on shore
nothing but their ammunition, which is to be musquet
cartridges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Tate is to have command in chief of the legion;
the Admiral will give the necessary orders to the officer
commanding the naval force, which will proceed up St.
George&rsquo;s Channel, and the landing is to be effected, if
possible, in or near Cardigan Bay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The instructions then give directions that the expedition
should make a feint of landing in Somersetshire, as was
afterwards done; and the most minute and careful suggestions are
made on the primary object of securing the co-operation of the
Welsh people&mdash;General Hoche remarks that the poor are the
most easy to rouse, as hunger makes <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>people discontented.&nbsp; His
followers, however, hardly carried out this truism in the way he
intended; they devoured everything they could lay their hands on,
and certainly succeeded in rousing the peasantry, but not exactly
to co-operation.&nbsp; The loyalty of the people must have been
an unpleasant surprise to the framers of the expedition.</p>
<p>It appears from the directions that two other legions were to
have simultaneously invaded the counties of Northumberland,
Durham, and York; these latter, however, never put in an
appearance.&nbsp; The primary object to be attained by the Second
Legion was the destruction of Bristol and Liverpool.&nbsp; On
reaching Severn Sea should the former prove impracticable, then
the legion was to land in Cardigan Bay, and march through Wales
to Chester and Liverpool.</p>
<p>These instructions are taken from a pamphlet printed for <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>J. Wright,
169, Piccadilly (1798), the text of which is copied from attested
transcripts of the original documents.&nbsp; The instructions
continue:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The expedition under the command of Colonel
Tate has in view three principal objects.&nbsp; The first is, if
possible, to raise an insurrection in the country.&nbsp; The
second is to interrupt and embarrass the commerce of the
enemy.&nbsp; The third is to prepare and facilitate the way for a
descent by distracting the attention of the English
Government.&rdquo; <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that the frigates did go up the Channel as
far as Ilfracombe, causing consternation among the small craft,
and great excitement on shore.&nbsp; They proceeded as far as
Ilfracombe, where they scuttled some merchantmen.&nbsp; A letter
is extant written by the town authorities to the Home
Secretary.&nbsp; The volunteer regiments were <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>on the alert,
and a considerable force was quickly mustered, which was possibly
the reason that the French did not land in Somersetshire, but
returning down the Channel made without any delay for the north
coast of Pembrokeshire.</p>
<p>As has been seen, the local regiments here were no less brisk
than their Somersetshire fellows.&nbsp; The Castle Martin
Yeomanry Cavalry now carry &ldquo;Fishguard&rdquo; on their
standard as well as upon the sabretaches of the officers, and
upon the pouches of the troopers, a distinction granted to them
in 1853, when the following letter was written by Lord Palmerston
to Sir John Owen.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Whitehall</span>, <i>May</i> 18, 1853.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have had the
honour to lay before the Queen the memorial of the officers,
non-commissioned officers, and privates of the Castle Martin
Yeomanry Cavalry (which you <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>transmitted to me), and I have the
satisfaction to inform you that Her Majesty is graciously pleased
to approve of the corps bearing the word &lsquo;Fishguard&rsquo;
on their standard and appointments.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I have the honour to be,
sir,<br />
&ldquo;Your obedient servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Palmerston</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John Owen, Bart., M.P.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is satisfactory to state that the Castle Martin Yeomanry
Cavalry still maintains its reputation for efficiency and
smartness, its team of ten men having won the inter-regimental
challenge cup, and proved themselves the best shots among the
forty competing yeomanry regiments in 1890, Corporal Williams, of
St. Florence, having made the highest score of any yeoman in the
kingdom.&nbsp; Thus giving us&mdash;the inhabitants of
Pembrokeshire&mdash;the satisfactory assurance <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that, should
invaders land on our coast now, they would meet with at least as
warm a reception as they did a hundred years ago.&nbsp; And this
suggests the idea that, in this age of centenaries, this strange
occurrence should not be forgotten, but that in 1897 the landing
of the French at Fishguard should be duly celebrated.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THREE FRIGATES.</span></h3>
<p>In the year of our Lord, 1797, there was a right fair day in
February.&nbsp; The day was a Wednesday, the twenty-second of the
month, and it was indeed the most pleasant day for that harsh
season of the year that I can call to mind on looking back
through the course of a long life.&nbsp; But it was not only the
unusual beauty of it that made that Wednesday in February a day
of mark, or I might scarcely have kept it stored in a corner of
my mind for seventy years <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>well-nigh&mdash;remarkable as fine
days are in this climate that is chiefly renowned for fine rain;
but for the reason that this particular Wednesday was a day of
utmost astonishment to all the dwellers on this North
Pembrokeshire coast, and (I may venture to add) a day of much
consternation to most of them.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A day still remembered by old Welsh fishwives, and still used
by them as a means of terror wherewith to hush to sleep unquiet
grandbabes, or to stir to patriotism stout but supine
grandsons.</p>
<p>I was, at the time of which I speak, but a youth of fifteen,
as thoughtless and careless as most lads of that age; not very
sensible to danger, save when it presented itself face to face
with me at no more than arm&rsquo;s length, under which
circumstances candour compels me to own I did not always enjoy
it.&nbsp; I trust that I may say without undue boasting that <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>I did not
fear anything greatly as long as it was out of sight, for which
reason I have often thought that had I been born a generation or
two later, and had I selected a soldier&rsquo;s career instead of
that of a divine I might have fought excellently at a distance of
a few miles from the enemy: though at close quarters I will admit
that any unexpected danger might perchance produce a sense of
amazement which the uncharitable might set down to
faint-heartedness.</p>
<p>But that my nephews, nieces, and neighbours generally may know
the truth concerning this matter&mdash;the landing of the French
at Fishguard in 1797, I, Daniel Rowlands, clerk, being aged, but
still of sound mind, have written this narrative&mdash;which when
duly set forth will, I hope, convince the most sceptical as to
the sort of spirit which animated my countrymen (if not myself),
and still more my countrywomen.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>On this
fair morning then, at about ten o&rsquo;clock, when I ought to
have been pursuing my studies under the fostering care of one of
the clergy at St. David&rsquo;s, I was in reality strolling along
the headland of that name, led astray by the beauty of the day,
which seemed too fair for book-lore; I was strolling along, doing
nothing, thinking of nothing, wishing for nothing, yet, having
found for the nonce the secret of true happiness, when I
perceived a man on horseback approaching me at a furious
rate.&nbsp; In spite of the pace at which he was advancing I
recognised him as a servant of Trelethin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither so fast, John?&rdquo; I shouted, in our own
tongue.&nbsp; He was past me as I spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The French, the French!&rdquo; came back to me on the
breeze mingled with the sound of his horses&rsquo; rushing
hoofs.&nbsp; His voice or my ears failed, for I heard no more
save&mdash;when <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>the thunder of the hoofs had ceased, the duller but more
continuous thunder of the waves rolling in freshly at the foot of
the rocks.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s words had left me much astonished.&nbsp; I
knew&mdash;from my studies under the divine above referred
to&mdash;that the French lived in France, where some of them had
lately been engaged in beheading the rest with the help of a
newly discovered machine.&nbsp; So much I knew, but why John
Trelethin should yell &ldquo;French&rdquo; at me as he passed,
riding apparently for his life, I knew not.&nbsp; What were the
French to him or to me?&nbsp; As I advanced pondering the
matter&mdash;but in a purely impersonal manner, and without any
keen interest&mdash;at a little distance further along the cliff
I espied the owner of Trelethin, John&rsquo;s master, standing
very firm on his legs against a background of bright sea, his
head inclining somewhat backward, while with <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>both his
raised-up hands he clutched a long spy glass, the small end
whereof was applied to his eye.&nbsp; Following the direction of
his spy-glass, I perceived a yet more astounding
sight&mdash;astounding to us used to the world of lonely waters
that lay stretched out in front of our homes.&nbsp; Three ships
of war were passing slowly along our coast not far from land,
they were accompanied by a smaller craft, which Mr. Williams
informed me was a lugger.&nbsp; As he had been a sailor I took
his word for it&mdash;but it did not make things clearer.&nbsp;
What did it all mean?&nbsp; What did those vessels&mdash;or their
inhabitants want here?&nbsp; They carried the English colours, I
saw that for myself when Mr. Williams obligingly lent me the
instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look for yourself, my boy,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;he was a man singularly free from
pride&mdash;&ldquo;Take a look at the blessed
Frenchmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He did not say exactly blessed, but <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>out of
respect to my cloth I subdue his expressions slightly.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frenchmen!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; Then those were the
French in those three vessels.&nbsp; I did not count the lugger,
not being sure of her.&nbsp; Strange to say the first thought
that flitted through my brain was one of pure joy; here was an
excuse, real, tangible, and startling, for having shirked my
studies.&nbsp; With a little help from imagination (his and mine,
which might act on each other as flint on steel, for he was an
excitable man), I trusted I might so alarm my clerical guide and
master as to make him quite forget the fact that I had given to
St. David&rsquo;s Head the time I should have given to my
own.&nbsp; The excuse might be made effective even should they
prove to be not quite really French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve English colours, sir,&rdquo; I said to
Mr. Williams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foreigners are deceitful,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;up <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>to any
tricks.&nbsp; I can see the scoundrels swarming on the
decks.&rdquo;&nbsp; (For by this time he again had applied the
spy-glass.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he continued, handing the
glass to his wife who had joined us, &ldquo;If it was but night
now and a bit stormy, we might put out a false light or two and
bring them on the rocks in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the moment afterwards immortalised by a local bard in
these words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Williams Trelethin was know every
tide<br />
From England to Greenland without guide.<br />
Mrs. Williams Trelethin was take the spy-glass,<br />
And then she cry out&mdash;There they Wass!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three tall ships sailed on calmly, with the clear shining
of the sea around them, dark objects in all that flood of
light.&nbsp; They went northward&mdash;along our Pembrokeshire
coast, where (had Providence so willed it) they might have made
shipwreck on the <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>sharp rocks anywhere.&nbsp; However the day was too fair
to admit of any such hope.</p>
<p>The alarm spread quickly; men and boys came bounding over the
gorse in every direction; even the women, with the curiosity of
their sex, came forth from their homesteads, leaving the cawl <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> and the children to mind themselves,
while their natural caretakers gaped open-mouthed at the tall
ships filled with untold dangers.</p>
<p>The crowd on the cliffs followed in the direction of the
ships, keeping them ever in sight.&nbsp; Helter-skelter we ran
along, crossing deep gullies, then along bare headlands covered
only with gorse and large grey stones, then passing under a great
mass of rock, like to some gaunt castle or fort (but alas,
lacking cannon), then, at rare intervals, where a stream ran into
the sea, we would dip suddenly into a smiling little valley
filled <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>with trees and bushes.&nbsp; But the stones and crags
prevailed greatly over the softer scenes.&nbsp; I had now entered
so fully into the spirit of this race that all thought of my
studies passed away; the fear of the dominee was merged in the
far greater fear of the French.&nbsp; And yet it was not wholly
fear that possessed me, but a sort of tremor of excitement, and
curiosity as to what might happen next.&nbsp; Noon passed, but
none stopped for food&mdash;nor even (till we came to a village)
for a Welshman&rsquo;s comfort in perplexity&mdash;a glass of
cwrw da. <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a></p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock, for no apparent reason, the Frenchmen
came to anchor.&nbsp; This was opposite to a rocky headland
called Carn Gwastad, which forms a portion of Fishguard Bay, some
distance to the west of the town of that name, and, by reason of
an intervening headland, quite invisible from it, and <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>in truth from
most other places.&nbsp; We had now come from St. David&rsquo;s
Head, a distance of full ten miles, and I, for one, was glad to
sit down on a gorse-bush and meditate a little as to what all
these things might mean and where they were like to end, which I
hardly dared to hope might somehow take the form of a bit of
dinner for myself.&nbsp; To stay hunger I composed my mind for a
nap while I reflected dreamily that my elders were taking more
definite steps for the defence of their country; and the
knowledge of this was gratifying to me.</p>

<p>Besides Mr. Williams&rsquo; John, who had been despatched at
full speed to St. David&rsquo;s to rouse the inhabitants, another
man was sent to give the news to the Lord-Lieutenant of the

name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>thereon, and
who probably lacked more ordinary society.</p>
<p>Many other messengers were sent in various directions, but
though in this way persons at a distance were warned of danger,
many of those who dwelt close by were as yet insensible of
it.&nbsp; Chiefest of these was the owner of the old manor house,
Trehowel, situated just above the bay where the ships were
lying-to&mdash;of which house we shall hear more anon.&nbsp; Mr.
Mortimer was of a generous and confiding disposition&mdash;and,
as a bishop should be, he was in truth&mdash;much given to
hospitality.&nbsp; He was, moreover, about to celebrate the
marriage of his son, and he had made ample provision of cakes and
ale, not to mention meats and spirits for this purpose.&nbsp; The
wedding was to be on the following day (Thursday, the 23rd of
February, to be exact); the new daughter-in-law was much <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to his mind,
and therefore heart and hand were even more lavish than usual,
when, looking out seaward from amidst the bridal greenery, his
spirit was stirred within him by the sight of the British
flag.</p>
<p>Nothing would serve this hospitable gentleman but that the
English officers should partake of his good cheer; so his orders
flew forth in every direction&mdash;compliments and invitations
to the officers, and directions to the servants as to the setting
forth of a sumptuous repast.</p>
<p>In the meantime one of the great ships, heaving anchor, had
quietly slipped round the corner&mdash;by which I would say,
rounded the next headland, Pen Anglas, in an undemonstrative
manner.&nbsp; Thus coming in sight of the men occupying the fort
near Fishguard; these fired as in duty and fair observance
bound&mdash;a salute to the flag that had braved a thousand
years, and <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>had never in all that considerable period of time been
put to a viler use than the present, when&mdash;hey presto! down
came the British colours with a run, and up flew the tricolour in
its stead&mdash;the red, white, and blue colours of the Republic
of the French.</p>
<p>The astonishment of those men in the fort at this unexpected
transformation-scene must have been akin to an electric shock
such as may be produced on the unwary by the careless placing of
a hand on a magnetic eel.&nbsp; They had been completely deceived
by the mock flag, and were more unprepared for the change than
those men who had already scrutinised the three frigates with
very doubtful eyes as they made their way along the coast of
Pembrokeshire.</p>
<p>All disguise was now over; the enemy showed under their true
colours at last, and <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>convinced even the most
liberal-minded (including Mr. Mortimer) that they were not
English.&nbsp; Though truly if they had desired to appear under
their most appropriate colour they should have sailed under the
black flag of piracy, for the men on board these frigates were
little better than freebooters.&nbsp; Many of the older persons
present were minded to take them for a new and enlarged edition
of the <i>Black Prince</i>&mdash;a pirate ship which had eighteen
years previously brought his broadside to bear on the town of
Fishguard, and kept up an animated fire all day with his
six-pounders.&nbsp; However, he caught a Tartar&mdash;the master
of a smuggling craft, who returned the fire with such goodwill,
aided by clever hands and a cannon at the edge of the cliffs,
that the <i>Black Prince</i> sheered off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Set a
thief to catch a thief;&rdquo; but it were ungrateful to think on
that proverb.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>It was
this circumstance which caused the fort at Fishguard to be
erected, one of whose nine-pounders had just, in courtesy,
saluted the frigate, who, not caring to face the other seven guns
of the fort in anger, turned round speedily, and rejoined her
companions at Carn Gwastad Point without loss of time.</p>
<p>On her way she intercepted a sloop which had&mdash;perhaps out
of curiosity, perhaps from some nobler motive&mdash;ventured too
near; probably the master of the sloop had not expected this
sudden rearward movement&mdash;anyway he found himself a
prisoner, and his boat a prize.&nbsp; I had jumped up from my
reclining position, and stood watching his fate with anxiety and
awe, knowing him to be a friend (for I was a Fishguard boy, and
intimate with all the varieties of seamen to be found there), but
being, at that distance, unable to tell which friend.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>All the
other boats in the bay stood out to sea with all speed, scudding
away with white sails stretched, reminding even a matter-of-fact
boy who abhorred poetry, similes, and all such inventions of
schoolmasters, suggesting even to me the sudden, outspread, white
wings of a flock of ducks frightened by the unwelcome appearance,
from round the corner, of a fox.&nbsp; They got away safe, but
the captive sloop was towed in triumph by the frigate back to
Carn Gwastad, where she found her sister ships were already
disgorging their freight of soldiers.</p>
<p>The sun was setting as the first boats set down their load on
British soil.&nbsp; There were not many spectators of this act
(the only one of a like nature since 1066, as far as my
knowledge&mdash;not very profound&mdash;of history went), the
inhabitants of the district, when they perceived that the landing
was <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>to be
on their own coast, having dispersed as quickly as a swarm of
ants amongst whom a foreign body is introduced&mdash;each one
making with the utmost speed for his own home in order to retreat
with his valuables (including his family) further into the
interior.&nbsp; I, however, was but young, and concluded that my
family, who lived in Fishguard, could very well take care of
themselves; while it was possible that my father, who was a
somewhat stern parent, might not even accept the (to me) absolute
necessity of keeping an eye on the French as a valid excuse for
departing from my studies at St. David&rsquo;s without leave from
my master.&nbsp; I had a certain amount of fear of the French, I
do not deny it; but it was as yet in the abstract, and was a very
different thing from the absolute fear I had of my father when I
caught him (and he caught me) in a bad mood.&nbsp; Besides, <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>though I
considered curiosity a childish and feminine quality, and as such
infinitely beneath my dignity, still I must own I did feel a sort
of craving desire to know what those people were going to do
next.&nbsp; So, hidden in a gorse bush on a headland which
commanded the creek, I watched the sun go down like a red ball
into the sea, throwing a light as of blood on the muskets in the
boats beneath me, making the dark figures that swarmed over the
sides of the ships look darker and more grimy, lighting up the
three-coloured flags that unfurled themselves to the night
breeze.&nbsp; Then there came a long path of crimson right across
the grey sea, which, dying out as the sun set, showed that this
fair day was gone&mdash;a day too fair and sweet to be the
setting for foul deeds.</p>
<p>Suddenly there rose a shriek, or, rather, a succession of
shrieks breaking through <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the twilight quiet, and a young woman
shot out like an arrow from the back door of Trehowel, darted
past me without pausing to answer a question, and, shrieking all
the time, fled away into the interior, clutching tightly in her
hand a foaming jug of beer.&nbsp; I heard afterwards that she ran
on for miles, still clutching that jug of beer, which she had
been drawing for the (supposed) English officers; when at last
her master had awakened to the fact that the French were actually
at his doors.&nbsp; She ran thus for miles, not even stopping to
drink the beer.</p>
<p>She was shortly after followed by Mr. Mortimer himself, who
came across the courtyard laughing in spite of the seriousness of
the occasion, for he must needs smile at a joke.&nbsp; He spied
me, for indeed I had jumped up to question Sally, and he came
towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor maid has had a scare,&rdquo; said <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>he, with a
twinkle still in his eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, in truth, Dan, my
boy, I suppose it is time to be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;about
Master Mortimer&rsquo;s wedding&mdash;and all the meats and
drinks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I never meant them for the
parley-vous,&rdquo; said he, mounting his horse which one of his
farm-boys had brought out; &ldquo;but I dare say they&rsquo;ll
enjoy them all the same&mdash;they won&rsquo;t be
wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned in the saddle to give a last look at his old house,
standing dark against a yellow-green twilight sky, pranked out
with all the mockery of boughs and flowery arches.&nbsp; The
trees in the courtyard had not yet put forth their leaves, but
branches of myrtles and ever-blooming gorse and great bunches of
primroses had made the place gay.&nbsp; Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s face
changed as he looked; he made no movement with <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the reins; he
was very loath to leave his home.&nbsp; In his mind&rsquo;s eye
he was viewing the heap of smoking ruins he might see when next
he came, and he seemed to be resolving to meet fate and the
French on his own threshold, when a woman&rsquo;s quick step came
out of the now-deserted house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, master,&rdquo; she cried, running up to us,
&ldquo;ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you off yet!&nbsp; Quick, there
isn&rsquo;t a minute; they are coming up the hill.&nbsp; For the
young master&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember, you have got the money and the papers.&nbsp;
Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, then shaking his rein, rode off without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do, Nancy?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time for you to be off
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no odds about me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll slip off
somehow, but I must get the silver spoons first.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Then
she turned from me, and her voice broke suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever is Davy&mdash;oh, wherever is he?&rdquo; she
sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Nancy, my maid,&rdquo; said I, being well
acquainted with her, and only ten years younger&mdash;an
inequality made up for by my superior station and parts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherever Davy is he&rsquo;s in mischief&mdash;that you may
take your davy of; but he always comes out of it
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope the reader will pardon this expression, but I was not
at this time even a curate&mdash;being but fifteen&mdash;and the
chance of my ever attaining that station seemed but remote.</p>
<p>At this moment the clang of arms and the sound of high-pitched
voices broke on our ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have those spoons if I die for it!&rdquo;
exclaimed Ann, who was not much given <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>to the melting mood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Run, Dan, make for Fishguard as fast as you
can.&rdquo;&nbsp; And without another word or a sign of personal
fear, Ann George disappeared into the house.</p>
<p>I will not deny now, after the lapse of so many years, that my
heart at this moment beat unpleasantly fast.&nbsp; I had already
watched the landing of some of the French troops, but from a
considerable distance, and there had been something unreal about
the scene, something like to play-acting, or a dream; but now
that I actually heard their voices, the effect was very
different.&nbsp; They were really here, close by; there was no
mistake about it.&nbsp; I had an almost overwhelming desire to
take to my heels and run for it, but in spite of a very real
fear, two feelings restrained me&mdash;one was a hesitation on
account of Nancy, whom it seemed mean to desert; <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the other was
that curiosity to which I have already alluded, and which
powerfully possesses most of the inhabitants of these regions,
but more especially the females.&nbsp; The twilight was rapidly
sinking into darkness as I crouched lower among the bushes and
peered out with eyes which doubtless resembled those of a
frightened bird.&nbsp; Never hare in its form felt more of a
flutter at the heart than I experienced as those screeching, and
yet savage, voices drew nearer and nearer.&nbsp; I did not
understand French, but if I had I trust I should not have
understood the nature of the expressions those men were
using.&nbsp; It must be remembered that at that time we were
accustomed to think of a Frenchman as of a two-legged
tiger&mdash;which we spelt with a y&mdash;and then perhaps the
horror that thrilled me may be understood.&nbsp; Suddenly the
vague terror was turned into reality, as between me and the <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>dusky sky
loomed forth a wild figure, then another and another, then a
confused crowd.</p>
<p>I could stand no more.&nbsp; With one bound I passed from
behind my bushes in through the back door of the house&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy, hang those spoons!&rdquo; I spoke in Welsh, and
I fear my expression was still more forcible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
this minute, I&rsquo;ll wait no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, who asked you to wait?&rdquo; said Ann George,
ungratefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be half-way to
Goodwick ere this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment her speech was interrupted by a sound as of
thunder at the front door, while the parlour window came flying
into the room before the butt-ends of French muskets.&nbsp; Even
Ann George thought it now high time to take her leave.</p>
<p>So we departed as quickly and as silently as possible through
the back door, while the front door was being shivered to atoms,
and <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the
enemy was pouring into the house over its remains.&nbsp; Quickly,
indeed, we went now and the falling night favoured us; the
enemy&rsquo;s own noise too rendered the slight addition of our
footfalls totally unobservable.&nbsp; All the space between
Trehowel and the cliffs swarmed with Frenchmen, and the uproar
was bewildering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make short work with your master&rsquo;s
ale, Nan,&rdquo; I gasped, as we ran along under the cover of the
earthen banks topped with gorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, and of the wine and the spirits, and of all the
poor young master&rsquo;s wedding feast.&nbsp; Oh, indeed, I wish
I had known they were coming when I was baking those pies and
brewing that ale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not waste my breath by inquiring the reason of this
aspiration, for the hill was rather heavy on my lungs, and her
meaning was obvious.&nbsp; In a very short time we <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>had reached
Brestgarn, the abode of a worthy divine, the Rev. David Bowen,
whom we found about to depart hurriedly, he having been no
quicker to hear the alarming tidings than his neighbour at
Trehowel; but, having heard it, he and his family were off for
the interior as fast as horses and fright could take them.&nbsp;
Only one of his servants, a man named Llewelyn, volunteered to
stay behind, to keep, as far as in him lay, an eye upon his
master&rsquo;s place and goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the top of Carnunda,&rdquo; suggested this
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can see everything from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carnunda is a rock situated just above most things in this
region; more especially just under it lies the tiny village and
church of Llanunda&mdash;Unda being manifestly a saint, though I
cannot truthfully say I ever heard anything about him&mdash;or
her.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>We got
up to the top of this carn then, and there snugly ensconced
between huge boulders of stone&mdash;the place is large enough to
hold six or seven hundred men, well protected by natural
rock-work&mdash;we gazed on the scenes all around us.</p>
<p>First at the creek beneath us.&nbsp; It was now pitch
dark&mdash;for the night was as black as the day had been
bright&mdash;but the three tall ships of war were lighted up with
cressets of fire; the lugger was there and the captured sloop,
and the sea around them was alive with boats, still conveying
troops to the land.&nbsp; The torches that they carried were
reflected on the waves, elsewhere inky black&mdash;but here
bearing long broken lines of light.&nbsp; Dark figures swarmed at
the landing place, if so one could call, what was merely some
flat slabs of rock; and all up the cliffs we saw ant-like beings
crawling, and even (by the aid of a little imagination) <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>we could
fancy we heard their strong exclamations at the steepness of the
path&mdash;made even steeper to them by the nature of their
occupation, for they were rolling casks (evidently heavy) of
gunpowder from where the boats landed them up to the top of the
cliff.&nbsp; Some of these dark figures carried torches which
shed a fierce glow for a small space through the black
night.&nbsp; As we looked, one of the casks which had been by
much effort shoved up to well-nigh the top of the cliffs,
suddenly slipped from the Frenchmen&rsquo;s hands and rolled
rapidly down the declivity&mdash;the roll speedily becoming a
succession of jumps and plunges, till with a wild leap the cask
fled over a final precipice and disappeared in the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord for that,&rdquo; said Llewelyn.</p>
<p>Nancy and I laughed aloud.&nbsp; It is impossible to give any
idea of the exultation that we felt.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>&ldquo;What words they are using over that!&rdquo; said
Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I wish we were near enough to hear
them!&rdquo; said I, totally unmindful of my future
profession.</p>
<p>But shortly after we had even greater cause of
rejoicing.&nbsp; The enemy (as we had already learnt to call
them) were disembarking their cannon, and lowering these
unwieldly articles of war into a long boat, but zeal outstripping
discretion, they so over-weighted the boat, that lurching forward
heavily she upset, and the whole of her cumbrous cargo was
shortly at the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; It was a satisfaction
even to think of it.&nbsp; Aye, and we may think of it still, for
to this very day those foreign cannon are rolling about and
rusting in the unquiet waters of Carrig Gwastad creek&mdash;a
proof, should one ever be needed, of the truth of this strange
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord again,&rdquo; said Llewelyn.</p>
<h3><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FATE OF THE CLOCK.</span></h3>
<p>Great bonfires now lit up the side of the hill beneath
Trehowel&mdash;in the place still called the French
camp&mdash;and scores of dark figures rushed about with torches
flaring wildly in their hands; the whole scene reminding one
forcibly of Pandemonium, that is, if one is capable of being
reminded of a place one has never seen and that one has no desire
to see.</p>
<p>Even the thought of it at the moment was unpleasant to me as
bringing my neglected studies to my mind, so I hastily turned my
attention once more to the French.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>The
boats and the sailors had now returned to their ships, having
landed the invading hordes (which was the term we usually applied
to the Gallic soldiers), who now seemed more bent on cooking than
on conquering, on supping than on surprising.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p75.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>We watched the erection of beams and bars over the huge fires;
and the slinging on to the bars of great pots and pans of all
sorts&mdash;mostly intimate friends of poor Nancy who watched all
these proceedings with many a groan and warm ejaculation as she
thought of all her wasted scrubbings in the back kitchen of
Trehowel.&nbsp; The precise number of the men who landed that
night on a bit (though remote) of Great Britain was fourteen
hundred; of whom six hundred were regular troops, and eight
hundred were convicts of the basest sort, described, indeed, in
the pamphlets of the time as the sweepings of the gaols.&nbsp;
Besides these, there were two <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>women; and had the fourteen hundred
been animated by the spirit which possessed these two of the
weaker sex, the result might have been much more unpleasant to
the Principality than it actually was.</p>
<p>The Welsh woman beside me was not by any means deficient in
spirit either, it even sometimes took the form of temper, yet to
my astonishment I heard the sound of sobs which could only
proceed from her, as Llewelyn was hardly likely to relieve his
feelings in this way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Master Dan, wherever is Davy?&rdquo; she again
asked.&nbsp; She called me &ldquo;master&rdquo; when she
remembered what I was going to be, otherwise my father being only
a small tradesman in Fishguard, I was more frequently called
Dan.&nbsp; I do not think I have given any description of Ann
George, boys do not, as a rule, think much of personal
appearance; nor did I.&nbsp; My idea of Nancy <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>had been
chiefly connected with the peppermints she had been in the habit
of giving me as a child; I thought her a person of a free and
generous disposition.&nbsp; She was a tall, fine young woman of
five and twenty, with dark hair and eyes (these last being dark
grey not brown), decided but pretty eyebrows, a well-shaped nose,
and rather large mouth which disclosed when she laughed or talked
(which was frequently) handsome white teeth.&nbsp; In short, she
was the type of a good-looking Welsh woman.&nbsp; She had also a
healthy colour, a warm heart, and a splendid appetite.&nbsp; It
was not very surprising that she had (or had had) two
admirers.</p>
<p>I at once referred to this fact with a boy&rsquo;s utter want
of delicacy in matters of sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you bothering about Davy for?&nbsp; I thought
it was Jim you liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever say that fellow&rsquo;s name
to me again, Dan&rsquo;el,&rdquo; said Nancy with animation, her
tears dried up and her eyes sparkling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope never
to hear of James Bowen again so long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I whistled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was that because he got into trouble
for horse-stealing?&nbsp; Why, as to that, Davy&rsquo;s none too
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear anwyl, Dan, talk of what you understand, or hold
your tongue!&nbsp; What do I care for their customs and
laws?&nbsp; &rsquo;Deed to goodness, nothing at all.&nbsp; As to
James Bowen if it had been only that&mdash;but there, a child
like you can&rsquo;t understand things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I!&rdquo; I shouted, thoroughly
incensed&mdash;of course we spoke in Welsh, and used a good many
more exclamations than I have set down here.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I, indeed.&nbsp; I only know smuggling
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quarrel, children,&rdquo; said Llewelyn,
who was of a quiet disposition.&nbsp; &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>shout or
you&rsquo;ll bring the French upon us.&nbsp; Silence holds it
here. <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; Just look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed towards the opposite direction to that in which we
had been looking, and where the French were still clambering
about the cliffs dragging up the last of their barrels of
ammunition and brandy.&nbsp; He pointed towards the steep road
which leads from Goodwick to Fishguard.&nbsp; This road was
thronged with people, horses, carts, furniture, cattle all mixed
together, and all (the animate ones at least) making their way
with such speed as their legs and the hill permitted away from
the immediate neighbourhood of the invaders.&nbsp; The lights
which some of them carried, and the glare from some gorse which
had been set on fire, lit up the straggling, toiling
multitude.</p>
<p>Further off the semi-circle of hills blazed with warning
beacons.&nbsp; It was a sight <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>never to be forgotten; a sight that
had not been seen in this island for centuries.&nbsp; From our
high nest in the rocks we had but to turn our heads to see
all.&nbsp; In front of us to the north stretched the sea; a
little to the north-west was the creek where the French had
landed, where we could dimly discern the tall masts of the
war-ships lighted up fitfully by cressets of fire.&nbsp; At the
top of the cliff was Trehowel, and close by was the French camp
surmounted by the tricolor flag.&nbsp; A little nearer us was
Brestgarn, where Llewelyn lived, and just at our feet was the
village and church of Llanunda.&nbsp; Goodwick lay to the east of
us; there was a steep hill down to it, a magnificent flat of
sands, with sea on one side and marsh on the other, and then a
steep hill up from it leading ere long to Fishguard.&nbsp; The
sea came round the corner from the north in order to form that
deep and beautiful <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Goodwick Bay, where trees and rocks, gardens and wild
waves, luxuriant vegetation and marshy barrenness are so
strangely mixed.&nbsp; Behind all, to the south and southeast
came the mountains; and towards the fastnesses therein most of
these fugitives were wending their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deuks!&rdquo; said Llewelyn, &ldquo;they are coming out
to see what they can get, the scoundrels; I must run back to
Brestgarn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me come,&rdquo; said I, on the impulse of the
moment&mdash;though my knees shook as I saw small dark clumps of
men leaving the main mass and coming towards us; but Llewelyn
inspired confidence, and curiosity has a courage of its own; then
I suddenly bethought me of Ann George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will you do, Nancy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to my Aunt Jemima, I&rsquo;ll be safe enough
with her; don&rsquo;t trouble about <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>me, my dear,&rdquo; said Nancy, our
short-lived quarrel being happily over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is in Fishguard, you can&rsquo;t go there alone,
wait a bit for me,&rdquo; said I, with youthful assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hide you at Brestgarn if you want to come, but
better go on to Fishguard,&rdquo; said Llewelyn.</p>
<p>By this time, however, we were almost at the farm, for we had
run down the steep side of Carnunda without any delay.</p>
<p>As we drew near to the house we found from the uproar therein
that it was already full of Frenchmen.&nbsp; Very cautiously we
approached a window and peeped in.&nbsp; We saw a strange
sight.&nbsp; The kitchen was filled with ragged ruffianly
fellows, all gesticulating with all their limbs, and screeching
with all their lungs.&nbsp; Of course we did not understand a
word they said, which, perhaps, was no loss under the
circumstances.&nbsp; They were dressed <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>in all sorts of uniforms&mdash;some
of them in a dusky red (our soldiers&rsquo; coats dyed, as I
afterwards heard), others wore the regular dark blue of the
French army.&nbsp; An enormous fire blazed on the hearth, on
which they had placed a large brass pan, geese and fowls only
half-feathered had been hastily thrown into it, and now they were
literally cramming it with butter, which they dug out of a cask
they had dragged in from the dairy.&nbsp; Suddenly a shout arose,
apparently from the ground beneath us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deuks!&rdquo; said Llewelyn, again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found the port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Llewelyn did not allude to any of the harbours in the
neighbourhood, but rather, it may be, to the lack of one, which
had perhaps occasioned the wrecking of a vessel from Oporto laden
with the wine of the district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No odds, don&rsquo;t fret for the wine,&rdquo; <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>whispered
Nancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get plenty again.&nbsp; I only
hope there&rsquo;s a good store of brandy in the houses,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We got our brandy in a different way, but also inexpensively,
and there was at times a considerable stock of it, and tobacco,
too, in the farmhouse cellars.</p>
<p>Llewelyn, however, was much perturbed: he had volunteered to
stay to look after the household goods, and he didn&rsquo;t seem
to be able to do much.&nbsp; The delight of the Frenchmen at such
an unexpected treasure-trove was indeed exasperating.&nbsp; Down
flowed the generous liquid through throats the outsides of which
were much in want of shaving, elbows were raised, and voices also
in the intervals of quaffing.&nbsp; Suddenly one man paused in
his potations, the brass face of the old clock that stood in the
corner had caught his eye, and the loud ticking of it had caught
his ear.&nbsp; Screeching something that sounded <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>like
&ldquo;enemy,&rdquo; he levelled his musket and fired straight at
the clock.&nbsp; The bullet went through the wood-work with a
loud sound of splitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brenhin mawr!&rdquo; yelled Llewelyn, forgetting all
caution in his exasperation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The scoundrels have
shot our eight day clock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately his remark was overheard; and indeed his yell
shot into the midst of those rioting ruffians like a pebble into
a wasp&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; Out they flew, evidently infuriated;
but we waited for no explanations, taking to our heels on the
instant, with the promptitude of extreme fear.&nbsp; Nan and I
were light of heel, and favoured by the darkness&mdash;yet more
black to those who came from that blaze of light&mdash;we got
clear away; but turning ere long to look, we perceived that
Llewelyn had not been so fortunate, he was older and a good deal
heavier than we <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>were; and then his righteous anger had rendered him
rather breathless before he began to run.&nbsp; He was now
surrounded by a crowd of foreigners, all jabbering and
gesticulating as hard as possible.&nbsp; Our hearts were sore at
having to leave our companion in this plight, but there was no
help for it, to attempt a rescue would have been, under the
circumstances, worse than folly.&nbsp; So we ran along across
country, avoiding all roads, and making straight for
Goodwick.</p>
<h3><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PRIEST&rsquo;S PEEP-HOLE.</span></h3>
<p>As Nancy and I puffed and panted in as noiseless a manner as
possible up the steep hill from Brestgarn, we saw, or, more
strictly speaking, we heard all around us, foraging parties of
the enemy, who were making off with everything they could lay
their hands upon.&nbsp; The screeching of poultry, the quacking
of ducks, the cackling of geese, the grunting and squealing of
pigs (I might go on as long as some foreign Delectus, but that I
fear to weary the reader) together with the oaths and laughter of
the Frenchmen, formed a medley of sound that might <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>have been
pleasing to the ears of a musician composing a symphony on rural
sounds, but that to a more ordinary listener formed a hubbub of
noise that was bewildering and extremely distasteful; while poor
Nancy&rsquo;s vexation at the fate of the dwellers in the
farm-yard equalled her indignation at the use made of her
well-scrubbed pans.</p>
<p>Not a single inhabitant of this district seemed to be left,
every cottage was deserted; all had fled for the present, in
order to turn again with greater force and rend the
intruder&mdash;as one may draw back for a space so as to gain the
necessary impetus for a spring.</p>
<p>We had reached the village of Llanunda, when we heard a
considerable body of the enemy marching along the road near us,
on their way to take possession of our rocky nest on the top of
Carnunda.&nbsp; This very strong position formed the
enemy&rsquo;s outpost, <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>and it ought to have been a matter of
no small difficulty to oust them therefrom, had they but planted
themselves firmly in it.</p>
<p>To our great dismay we now heard voices approaching us from
the other side; these proved to be some of the foraging parties
making themselves acquainted with the larders and cellars of all
the neighbouring houses.&nbsp; We crouched down lower among the
gorse bushes, and I at least knew precisely the sensations
experienced by a hunted and hiding hare.&nbsp; When this danger,
too, was happily overpast, at all events for the moment, Nancy
whispered to me&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, they are a deal too near us here, and
there&rsquo;s more coming.&nbsp; I know a better hiding-place
than this.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s make for the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assented willingly; and we made as fast as we could for the
church.&nbsp; It was a small but ancient building, full of queer
holes and <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>corners, with the which Nancy was better acquainted than
I was, it being her parish church.&nbsp; The door was happily
unfastened, but no Frenchmen had as yet invaded the sacred
building, for we took the precaution of looking through the
&ldquo;leper&rsquo;s hole&rdquo; as soon as we had entered the
porch.&nbsp; The leper&rsquo;s hole is a little square window,
the sides of which are so sloped as to command a view of the
interior of the church, more especially of the chancel; so that
in the old times even these miserable wretches&mdash;set apart in
the porch&mdash;might still behold the high altar.</p>
<p>We then looked with eagerness through this orifice, and
perceived gladly that the building was dark and empty.&nbsp; So
pushing open the door, we entered our sanctuary as though it had
been a veritable city of refuge.&nbsp; Our first care was to
secure the door as well as we could on the inside; then Nancy sat
<a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>down in
order to fetch her breath, while I reviewed the place and the
situation.&nbsp; Neither were to my mind when I came to think of
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you come here for, Nan?&rdquo; I
inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be
caught here like rats in a trap.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t hide in the
pulpit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather a gorse-bush in the open,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, Dan, till I fetch my breath&mdash;and
don&rsquo;t talk; they may hear you,&rdquo; said Nancy, not
considering that she was talking herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh do make haste with your breath,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and tell me where it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was full of
curiosity to know where her hiding-place could be: the church was
pitch dark, a few minutes of silence there seemed an age.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in a vault, is it?&rdquo; I continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vault&mdash;bless the boy&mdash;no!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not going into a vault before I can help it.&nbsp; Well, if you
won&rsquo;t be quiet, I suppose I&rsquo;d better <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>show you the
place.&nbsp; It is at the other side of the church.&nbsp; Come
across quietly, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did go across as quietly as we could, considering the pitch
darkness of the place, all blocked up with high pews according to
the fashion of the time.&nbsp; In my after-career I had often
occasion to reprove the occupiers of like boxes, who, trusting to
their wooden walls to screen them, slumbered happily within a few
yards of me, utterly forgetful of the treachery of their own
noses.</p>
<p>After having injured her shins several times over unexpected
obstacles, Nancy sighed forth, &ldquo;Oh for a light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh for something to eat!&rdquo; I responded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a flint and steel in my pocket; but I
can&rsquo;t eat that.&nbsp; You can have it if you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t strike a light,&rdquo; said Nancy;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got a bit of cheese in my pocket along with
the silver spoons.&nbsp; Here, stretch out your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt
impelled by manners to say this, though I felt wolfish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I.&nbsp; I had my dinner as usual.&nbsp; I put it
in my pocket in case of meeting&mdash;a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your&mdash;friends like cheese?&rdquo; I asked with
my mouth full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to, any way,&rdquo; retorted Nancy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hear them coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bolted the cheese in a panic.&nbsp; I felt much more afraid
of the French since I had seen them so near in Brestgarn kitchen,
and since they had nabbed Llewelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the hole&mdash;you go first.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll close it up after us with a pew door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy dexterously lifted one off its hinges, while I, mounted
on the back of a pew, groped my way into a pitch dark cavity in
the wall, the entrance to which was situated at the height of
some three or four feet above the floor-level.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;Take care, there are steps,&rdquo; said Nan, just
as I had discovered the fact by the aid of my shin-bone.&nbsp;
She was still wrestling with the pew door, and I smothered my
agony chiefly, I must own, from fear of the French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on a bit higher up, Dan,&rdquo; whispered Ann, as
she followed me, dragging the door after her as quietly as she
could.&nbsp; Nancy was certainly a wonderful woman, with a head
on her shoulders.</p>
<p>At this moment I felt that it was so, for I was propelled
somewhat violently upward by the member in question.&nbsp; I can
also add my testimony that she was a hard-headed woman.&nbsp; She
was also perhaps a little hard-hearted, for in answer to my
remonstrance, &ldquo;Hold hard, Nancy, that hurts!&rdquo; she
merely said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do get on, Dan; I expect them here every
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did get on, and found after mounting <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>half-a-dozen
steps of a twirling stair, that my head was opposite an opening
just at the place where the roof of the church sprung; one of the
oaken beams was, in fact, a little scooped out to make room for
this slit, which being under the heavy shadow of the woodwork was
almost completely screened from the glances of those below; while
to the person placed behind this coign of &rsquo;vantage the
whole of the interior of the church was visible&mdash;chancel as
well as nave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a queer place&mdash;what&rsquo;s it for,
Nancy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is called the Priest&rsquo;s Peep-hole; I suppose
in old times he got a friend to go up there and keep an eye on
the congregation&mdash;see who went to sleep, and what they were
at altogether,&rdquo; explained Nan; but at this moment her
eloquence came to a sudden end.&nbsp; Our voices and our hearts
died within us, for there came to our ears the dreaded <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>but expected
sound&mdash;the clamorous jabber of many tongues.</p>
<p>The sounds came from the churchyard, but I doubt if even a
company of good Welsh ghosts would have frightened us as much as
these earthly foreigners.&nbsp; Very, very earthly and
carnal-minded did they seem to us at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t come into a church&mdash;they
won&rsquo;t rob a church!&rdquo; I whispered to Ann, leaning my
head down close to her&rsquo;s&mdash;a difficult feat, but I was
as thin as a lath then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said Ann, scornfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You wait a minute&mdash;Hst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&rsquo;s appreciation of character and computation of time
proved equally correct.&nbsp; She had fixed the pew-door by this
time, and she held it firmly in its place by the handle, which
she had taken care to put on the inward side when she lifted up
the barrier across the entrance to the stair.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t fire through that like
they did through the clock at Brestgarn, on the chance of finding
some one behind it,&rdquo; I whispered to my companion as this
comfortable idea flashed through my mind, even the terror of the
French failing to curb my natural love of suggesting a
terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hst!&rdquo; retorted Nan; &ldquo;hold your tongue,
can&rsquo;t you, and keep your head down; don&rsquo;t let them
see you peeping, Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s caution to me came not a moment too soon, for
crash! a rush of men and muskets at the door, whose rickety bolts
we had drawn when we entered, chiefly in the hope that they might
not be tried.&nbsp; But if we drew them as a sort of charm, the
spell was not strong enough, nor were the locks.</p>
<p>C-r-a-ck&mdash;<i>crack</i>! the feeble bolts gave a groan,
and open flew the door with a sharp, splitting sound.&nbsp; In
rushed ten or a dozen Frenchmen, tumbling over one another in <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>their
haste.&nbsp; The church was lighted up with a sudden blaze from
their torches; this was all I saw, for on the entrance of the
enemy I had ducked my head speedily.&nbsp; Ann could see still
less, as she was crouched on the bottom step, and was keeping the
door in its place with her knees.</p>
<p>The noise in the church was terrific, but yet to my ears the
beating of my heart was still louder.&nbsp; The more I tried to
silence it, the more it ticked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s a clock,&rdquo;
I reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet after a while, as I grew more accustomed to the clamour, I
became possessed by a desire to know what these men were
doing.&nbsp; Very cautiously I raised my head.&nbsp; I feared my
hair must be standing on end, which would make it more
perceptible by an inch or two.&nbsp; Instinct had made me take
off <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>my
hat as we entered the building; in crossing the dark aisle I had
dropped it, and I hoped sincerely no one would find it, as it
might lead to unpleasant investigations.&nbsp; Planted finally on
my hands and knees, I raised myself till my eyes were on a level
with the lowest part of the priest&rsquo;s peep-hole, and then,
even veiling my eyes with half-closed lids as a precaution, I
glanced furtively forth at the foreign marauders beneath
me.&nbsp; They had not gone through the ceremony of removing
their hats, and their object in entering the sacred edifice was
evidently simply the hope of plunder.&nbsp; With the butt ends of
their muskets they knocked and thrust at everything, as if to
ascertain of what it was made, and whether anything of value
might not be concealed within it.&nbsp; One half-drunken fellow
came and gave a mighty bang to the cushion belonging to the
pulpit, which he snatched from its proper position <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>and dashed
against the wall, immediately under my spy-hole.&nbsp; I imagine
that the worthy incumbent must have been less given to pulpit
thumping than most of his fellows, for out flew a cloud of dust,
reaching even to my nostrils.&nbsp; A smothered sneeze was the
result.&nbsp; Instantly I felt myself violently pulled by the leg
from below; indeed, so provoked was Nancy that she could not
resist giving me a shake, though I am sure the candid reader will
allow I was not to blame in the matter.</p>
<p>Unluckily the Frenchman had heard the sneeze, and some
animated conversation went on between him and his companions,
who, however, seemed inclined to ridicule his assertions.&nbsp;
Judging from the tone of their remarks (for Nancy held too tight
a grip of me to allow of my seeing anything), I should say that
their language to each other was not so polite as one might have
expected <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>from men of their nation.&nbsp; However, my particular
enemy did not seem inclined to allow himself to be set down after
this fashion; for, dropping his cushion, he proceeded to make an
investigation with his clubbed musket.&nbsp; Walls, pews, and
benches, he thumped them all indiscriminately, giving a sounding
whack to the door which closed our retreat.&nbsp; But
Nancy&rsquo;s knees did not flinch, though they must have
received a most unpleasant jar.&nbsp; Luckily the entrance to the
hidden stair was in a very dark and out-of-the way corner, and
also at a very unusual height from the ground.&nbsp; Mercifully
at this moment our tormentor&rsquo;s attention was distracted by
a shout from his comrades, who had entered the little vestry, and
had forced open the cupboard containing the sacramental
vessels.&nbsp; These were very ancient, and were of silver, and
the glee of the finders was easily understood even by those in
our retired situation.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Others of the invaders broke open the chest containing
the parish records, but, much disappointed by the nature of the
contents, they tore forth the documents and tossed them on the
floor of the church.&nbsp; Human nature was no longer to be
restrained, neither by fear nor by Ann, so I once more popped my
head up and beheld a strange sight.&nbsp; One of the men had
thrown a torch in among the parchments and papers, a bright flame
lighted up the dark interior of the church, and shone on the
fierce faces of the men around the fire, two of whom were
struggling for the possession of the communion cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven, we shall be burnt like rats, Nan!&rdquo;
I whispered to my companion, but she answered by her favourite
expression, &ldquo;Hst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One soldier, I imagine by way of a joke, now threw the pulpit
cushion on the flames, <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>whereupon such dense clouds of smoke
arose as speedily cleared the church of the invaders, but alas,
nearly stifled us, the lawful inhabitants.&nbsp; Luckily the
floor of the church was of slate, and the fire was not very near
any woodwork.</p>
<p>Nancy insisted that we must bear our suffocation in silence
and motionless, and though my eyes watered and my heart rebelled,
not a cough nor a wheeze, nor even a word, did I suffer to escape
me, but to my thoughts at least I gave free rein.&nbsp; After a
while these too played the truant, wandering away from my enemies
and dreamily fixing themselves on my master at St. David&rsquo;s,
my school friends, my books, the moving waters that framed in
every picture of my life, till, becoming more and more
indistinct, I imagine that I must have fallen fast asleep, though
this is a matter that none can speak of with any certainty till
it comes to the <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>sharp act of awakening, which act assures us, in the
most matter-of-fact manner, that we have been asleep.</p>
<p>In this way, by a sharp fact, indeed, no other than
Nancy&rsquo;s elbow, I made the discovery that, in spite of my
uncomfortable position, I must have fallen sound asleep, tired
out by my long walk and many subsequent runs, and fatigued also
by the number of new ideas forced on my mind by the action of the
extraordinary events of the day and the many bewildering things I
had seen and heard since breakfast time that morning.</p>
<p>It seemed to me to have been but a few minutes from the time
the French left us choking in the smoke till I felt that elbow of
Nancy&rsquo;s, of which I took no notice.&nbsp; Indifferent to
this silent scorn, she now pulled me vigorously by the leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Dan!&nbsp; Wake up, boy; we must <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>get away
from here at once; we ought to have gone long ago, but I fell
asleep, worse luck.&nbsp; Come now, at once, it&rsquo;s just
daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had, indeed, quite suddenly, as it seemed to me, reached
the morning of Thursday.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">DAVY JONES&rsquo; LOCKER.</span></h3>
<p>The fear of the French returning suddenly shook the drowsiness
out of my eyes.&nbsp; I gave them a final rub, then stumbled down
the crooked steps after Nancy.&nbsp; How she could have guessed
that it was now near dawn&mdash;as in our corner it was still
pitch-dark&mdash;was a mystery to me; but probably the habit of
waking up daily at an extremely early hour, as was the wont of
milk-maids in those days, had accustomed her to know the time to
a nicety.</p>
<p>We crept as quietly as we could down from our uncomfortable
hiding-place, so stiff <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>and cramped that we could only move
with difficulty, and every bone made its particular position
known with great accuracy, even to us who were totally
unacquainted with anatomy.&nbsp; Then we carefully reconnoitred
our situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p109.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>As far as we could see, looking through the church windows on
every side, we gazed only into the dim dusk of early morning into
a lifeless world.&nbsp; No little bird as yet sent up his morning
song; there were no sheep or cattle to be seen, their lawful
owners or the invaders having driven them off to securer quarters
or to sudden death, as the case might be.&nbsp; The church
itself, after the late uproar, seemed very silent now; the fire
had quickly died down, smothered by the pillow; only the heavy
smell of smoke remained to prove that the wild doings of the
night had not been a terrifying dream.</p>
<p>We crept along to the leper&rsquo;s hole, using <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>the other
end of it now; for the unfortunate outcasts of former days had
gazed through the tube into the church, while we unhappy
fugitives looked warily from the interior into the porch, to see
if haply some blue-coated soldier might have been left there on
guard.&nbsp; But if this had been the case he had certainly
declined to stay, which was not unlikely considering the lax
discipline, or, rather, total want of discipline, which prevailed
in the French force.&nbsp; At all events, the porch was
empty.</p>
<p>So after a little getting behind each other and a slight
backwardness in going forward, owing more to uncertainty of light
than natural timidity, at last we ventured out boldly into the
porch, and took a good look, our necks stretched out over the
churchyard and round the country.&nbsp; The former seemed silent
and deserted, the tombstones looming darkly into dim twilight,
which still lay heavy <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>on the land; nor could we even
discern any sound of snoring.&nbsp; Carnunda was crowned with
fires and thronged with soldiers, but it was not very near, and
we thought we might slip away unnoticed.&nbsp; So, cautiously we
closed the door behind us, and fared forth.&nbsp; The porch lay
to the south of the church; we were stealing round the building
to the north, or seaward side, as being further removed from
Carnunda, when we were stopped by a sudden shout, proceeding
apparently from the air above us.&nbsp; Our hearts stood still
and our blood froze with terror&mdash;at least, I know mine did,
and Nancy turned an ashy white in the grey dawn.&nbsp; In an
instant we looked up to the place from which our enemy had spied
us&mdash;the roof of the church, where he had been stationed as a
sentinel.&nbsp; He sat astride on the ridge, which could be
easily gained by means of a flight of steps, made on the outside
of the roof, as <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>a look-out place from which to signal to those at sea;
but never designed for such a purpose as the present.&nbsp; The
discipline had not been so lax as we hoped.&nbsp; For a moment we
were stupefied, wishing only that one of the graves would open
and take us in.&nbsp; Then we took to our heels.&nbsp; Down came
the Frenchman clattering over the roof of the church, from the
edge of which he dropped to the ground, only a distance of eight
or nine feet; then he came full cry after us.&nbsp; His shouts
had attracted the attention of a couple of his fellows, who were
strolling along the cliffs in search of what they could devour,
or, still better, drink.&nbsp; They joined the chase instantly,
and all three came full tear after Nancy and myself, who had
headed straight for the cliffs, as one of our own foxes would
have done, though what we were to do when we gained them save
plunge into the sea we knew not.&nbsp; However, we were not fated
to <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>gain
them just at present, for one of the Frenchmen had outrun Nancy,
whose limbs were still cramped, and who was weary from want of
rest and sleep.&nbsp; I was stiff and tired too, but fear of the
French made me fly, and would have done so I think had I been
doubled up by rheumatism.&nbsp; However, though Nan was caught,
and warned me of her disaster by a shrill scream, I am glad to
say she preserved her usual Welsh spirit, as she plainly showed
by fetching the Frenchman a sounding box on the ear.&nbsp; I
hesitated what to do, divided between fear of the French and the
desire of standing by my friend.&nbsp; I am glad to say I had
advanced a few steps towards an attempt at rescue, when some dark
body rushed past me in the dawning light, and ere I could even
exclaim, the Frenchman lay flat on the ground.&nbsp; The other
two, half drunk, and wholly stupefied, perceiving that things
were going somewhat <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>crookedly, departed as quickly as
they could, making for the camp at Carnunda.&nbsp; Our rescuer
had a mind to follow them, but Ann laid a restraining hand upon
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dio bach,&rdquo; <a name="citation115"></a><a
href="#footnote115" class="citation">[115]</a> she said, &ldquo;I
am glad to see you this time, if I never was before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she really looked as if she could have kissed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy, how came you here; why didn&rsquo;t you go away
with the rest?&rdquo; asked Davy Jones, abruptly, his voice rough
and angry.&nbsp; He had had too great a scare to be tender or
even civil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I had to stop and see to everything&mdash;and the
silver spoons,&rdquo; said Nancy, quite meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the silver spoons,&rdquo; said Davy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s to be done with this
carcase?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pointed to the unconscious
Frenchman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get out of the way, Nancy, and I&rsquo;ll
shove him over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t waste time,&rdquo; exclaimed
Nancy; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have the whole lot after us in a
minute; they&rsquo;re as thick as ants on Carnunda.&nbsp; How can
we get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the cliff as fast as you can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got
a boat down below; if we can get to the caves we&rsquo;ll do; but
I had some of them after me a little while ago, and I landed here
to get rid of them, and to find out what had become of you, for
Llewelyn of Brestgarn told me you were somewhere near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Llewelyn is a prisoner; did you see him?&nbsp; Is he
safe?&rdquo; asked Nancy, as we hurried along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, quick and quiet; I&rsquo;ll tell you in the
boat,&rdquo; whispered Davy.</p>
<p>We plunged down through dry bracken, gorse bushes, and large
boulders of stone, interspersed with steep pieces of cliff.&nbsp;
We jumped, slid, and tumbled down, clutching hold of grasses and
ferns to stay our speed, <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>and in a few moments we had reached
the level of the sea.</p>
<p>The boat had been so cunningly hidden&mdash;with the dexterity
of constant practice&mdash;that Nan and I quite failed to
discover it.&nbsp; Davy, however, had it out in a trice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in, boy, and give a hand to Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy did not require a hand, she jumped in very steadily, and
took the rudder.&nbsp; Davy threw me one oar, took the other
himself, and we were off, stealing noiselessly along under the
great cliffs, where darkness still dwelt.&nbsp; But the sky over
our heads grew lighter every moment, and we ruefully perceived
that ere long it would be broad day.&nbsp; Yet it seemed safer to
be on the water than on the land, where we could even now discern
dim figures looking for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what is that?&rdquo; in a horror-struck whisper
from Ann.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span><i>That</i> was a dark blue object, very unpleasing to
behold, sodden with water, and wedged in a crevice of the
cliffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is one of them,&rdquo; said Davy, grimly,
&ldquo;cleft to the chin by a scythe in a Welshman&rsquo;s
hands.&nbsp; The ruffians had burnt his cottage, with his old
mother in it; he caught this one, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I wish
I had served that fellow up there the same, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Davy?&rdquo; I asked, to divert
his remorseful thoughts, and unable to restrain my curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among these blacks of parlez-vous.&nbsp; They nabbed me
last night as neat as could be&mdash;we had a bit of a scrimmage
though.&nbsp; I was coming back from a little bit of
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Davy, you shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; from Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I got in too near, never expecting ships here; who
would?&nbsp; We were round the corner and on them almost, before
we <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>knew
it; we made off then, but they saw us and gave chase.&nbsp; We
made as fast as we could for a place I know, a good
out-of-the-way cave&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got a few about here,
Nan&mdash;and they came after us.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d some man who
knew the coast among them, that I&rsquo;ll swear; any stranger
must have found out the sharpness of our rocks; but not a bit of
it.&nbsp; On they came quite comfortable, and close behind us
they were as we got to the mouth of the cave.&nbsp; Levi Mathias
stood up in the bow of the boat ready to jump ashore when one of
the French marines shot him.&nbsp; I hope to have something to
say before that&rsquo;s done with yet.&nbsp; Out tumbled our men
anyhow, running through the surf and up the cliffs, into the
darkness anywhere, for the Frenchmen carried torches as well as
muskets.&nbsp; Well, they nabbed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t like to leave Levi,&rdquo; said Nancy,
softly.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like to leave the brandy,&rdquo;
said Davy.&nbsp; &ldquo;They got it, though, and me, tight
enough.&nbsp; It put them into a good temper, however, and they
didn&rsquo;t shoot me through the head, like they did a farmer
that they made help to roll up their casks of ammunition, when he
tried to escape.&nbsp; They made me carry up one of my own kegs
which went against the grain; then they took me to their
chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the chief?&rdquo; I asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed to goodness, yes&mdash;General
Tate&mdash;no more a Frenchman than I am; Irish, I&rsquo;m
thinking.&nbsp; He seemed very uneasy, and none of his men minded
him.&nbsp; I had company&mdash;John Owen, of the sloop
<i>Britannia</i>, laden with culm for Llanstinan&mdash;they
didn&rsquo;t care for culm, and were cross to him, and a mortal
fright he was in, but had sense enough left to tell them a lot of
lies.&nbsp; <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Then I saw Llewelyn, and had a word on the sly with
him; he told me you were hereabouts; I watched my chance, and an
hour or two ago I slipped down over the cliffs, seized this boat,
and made off; but they saw me from one of the ships, and gave
chase, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cry interrupted him, succeeded by a loud splashing of
oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, hang them, there they are again.&nbsp; Why-ever
couldn&rsquo;t you hold your tongue, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was unjust, as Davy had done all the talking himself; but
the present was no moment for arguing.&nbsp; We bent to the oars
with a will and in silence, till my hands were blistered, my
heart panting, and my back breaking, and still the enemy were
gaining on us.</p>
<p>Nancy leant forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change with me for a spell, Dan.&nbsp; I can
row.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>On we
went again, fast, faster, and still the other boat came on after
us yet more rapidly&mdash;it was like a nightmare.&nbsp; We came
in very close to the cliffs now, and Davy took both oars.&nbsp;
In between two reefs of rocks we went&mdash;a deep channel, yet
full of treacherous windings and turnings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll do now,&rdquo; said Davy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please Providence, they may easily be smashed to atoms
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he looked gratefully at the sharp rocks.</p>
<p>But I turned after a little, and beheld that phantom-like
pursuer still following us closely through the windings of the
passage.&nbsp; The reefs had now become high cliffs, and seemed
to close us in on every side; but as we came round another corner
we saw before us a low archway.&nbsp; Through this we shot, and
we found ourselves as it were at the bottom of a tea-cup, with
precipitous walls on every <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>side; just in front of us a little
sandy beach.&nbsp; Davy pushed the boat towards a narrow slit in
the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in there, my girl,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; if you slip, I&rsquo;ll catch
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy jumped at once, I followed her, landing half in and half
out of the water, but quickly drawing myself up to be out of
Davy&rsquo;s way, who came with a mighty rush&mdash;at the same
time spinning the boat to the other side of the creek&mdash;only
just in time, the Frenchmen were in the archway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on as far as you can,&rdquo; whispered Davy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If they see this slit, they can only come one at a time,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t finish, but it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.&nbsp;
Nan and I stumbled on in the interior, and found ourselves ere
long in quite a large cave, where even in the dusky light we
could discern objects extremely like kegs, also bales and
packages of all sorts.&nbsp; Outside we heard <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the cries
and screams of the Frenchmen, baulked of their prey; for
(probably fortunately for themselves) they did not discover the
narrow and hidden entrance to our cave.&nbsp; We were soon joined
by Davy, who remarked that if they had a guide with them, there
were a few things he didn&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of food here&mdash;and
spirits&mdash;if we want to stay,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;but
perhaps we may as well get to the top and see what is going
on.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WELSH WIVES.</span></h3>
<p>We did prefer (as soon as we had got our breath again) knowing
what was going on in our usual world overhead to remaining in
ignoble security in Davy&rsquo;s locker, for so we named his
cave.&nbsp; Accordingly we scrambled and crawled and pushed our
way up the far-end of the cavern, till at last the aperture
resembled a chimney lined with ferns instead of soot more than
aught else.&nbsp; We emerged at last into the open air full of
morning sunshine, and perceived that we were now quite beyond the
enemy&rsquo;s lines and once more among our own people.</p>
<p>The first thing to be done in this situation <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>was
naturally&mdash;to talk; as good and true Celts we all agreed to
that; and when we got into the high-road we found no dearth of
people to talk to.&nbsp; They were gathering like ants from every
quarter, and the one topic which each man liked to discourse on
was simply this: how he was going to fight the French.&nbsp; The
bonfires last night had aroused the country, and some of the men
we met had come from distant parts of the county.</p>
<p>Among other items of news they told us that the men of St.
David&rsquo;s had rushed in a body to their cathedral, from the
roof of which they had insisted on tearing off the lead; six
blacksmiths had come forward, and had at once cast the said lead
into bullets.&nbsp; Old and young, master and man, all had turned
out.&nbsp; A dissenting minister was there (the Reverend Mr.
Jones was his name), and after him marched all the men of <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>his
congregation.&nbsp; The news had come as he was preaching to
them, and the worthy man had at once changed rhetoric for
action.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us fight a good fight,&rdquo; said he,
and proceeded to put his words to the proof and himself at the
head of his men.</p>
<p>A choleric major rode about the lanes near St. Dogmael&rsquo;s
collecting recruits.&nbsp; He met a Mr. Jones (another one):
&ldquo;Come along to fight the French,&rdquo; was Major
James&rsquo; greeting.&nbsp; But Mr. Jones had business which
called him elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Lord Harry,&rdquo; said the Major, drawing his
sword, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t come this minute I&rsquo;ll
slice your head off like a turnip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fear of the French was an unknown quantity, but the fear
of the Major was very well known indeed, and Mr. Jones went.</p>
<p>We mingled exultantly with the throng of our people, and
presently our eyes were gladdened by the sight of a gallant body
of <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>men&mdash;all well equipped and well mounted&mdash;the
Castle Martin Yeomanry.&nbsp; These were joined by the
Cardiganshire Militia, the Fencible Infantry of Colonel Knox, and
some seamen and artillery, the whole under the command of Lord
Cawdor.</p>
<p>We had got into Fishguard by this time, and we hung about the
door of the &ldquo;Royal Oak,&rdquo; where a council of war was
being held by our officers&mdash;namely, Lord Milford, Lord
Cawdor, Colonel Knox, Colonel Colby, Colonel Ackland, Colonel Dan
Vaughan, Major James, and the Governor of Fishguard Fort, Colonel
George Vaughan.&nbsp; The troops formed in the turnpike road just
outside the town, and here we three had to separate, for Davy
wished to accompany the troops, Ann to join her Aunt Jemima, and
I to get something to eat at my father&rsquo;s house, for I had
only had hasty snatches hitherto, and I had a growing boy&rsquo;s
appetite.&nbsp; My <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>parent was so much astonished at the course of events
that he was not even surprised to see me when I walked, as bold
as brass, into his shop; and never even asked if I had taken
French leave of my master.&nbsp; But before satisfying my natural
filial affection I (together with Davy) escorted Nancy to the
abode of her relative, who, however, was not at home.&nbsp; As we
turned to go, Nancy having taken leave of Davy in an affectionate
manner, because, as she said, he had appeared just in the nick of
time, we espied that stalwart female, Jemima Nicholas, coming
along the road from Goodwick surrounded by twelve Frenchmen, <a
name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129"
class="citation">[129]</a> whom she had had the courage and
address to bring&mdash;probably allured by false
promises&mdash;all the way from Llanunda; assisted by the
military, she now conducted them into the guard-house at
Fishguard.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Leaving Nancy under the efficient protection of her
aunt with light hearts, Davy and I went our several ways; but ere
long, after recounting my adventures and receiving a large amount
of hero-worship from my mother, I once more found myself on the
road leading to the scene of action.&nbsp; It seemed impossible
to keep away.&nbsp; On the top of a high rock I saw a crowd of
people in a state of great and evident excitement.&nbsp; I
hastened to join them, and perceived at once the reason of their
gesticulations.&nbsp; There were the three tall men-of-war and
the lugger, with all sail set, standing out from the land, and
apparently sailing away with all speed to the place from whence
they came.&nbsp; We could hardly believe our eyes.&nbsp; We
looked at Carnunda; there floated the French flag, and the rocks
were dark with men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord hath delivered them into our <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>hand,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr. Jones, who stood
near.</p>
<p>This sight increased the confidence of our people amazingly,
as much as (we afterwards heard) it struck dismay into the hearts
of General Tate and his men, they not being animated by the
spirit which moved the classic heroes to burn their boats so as
to destroy the means of retreat and to force themselves to
action.&nbsp; The base desertion of their comrades, the large
supply of brandy in the farm-house cellars, and a providential
but comic mistake, seem to have been the three principal causes
of the failure of the French&mdash;one may say of the utter and
singular collapse of their undertaking.</p>
<p>The mistake occurred in this manner.&nbsp; Large numbers of
the country-women (among whom were Jemima and Nancy) had
assembled on a hill commanding an extensive prospect, including
the French <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>outpost at Carnunda, desiring, with the curiosity of
their sex, to see as much as possible of what was going
forward.&nbsp; It was, by the way, the same hill on which I had
also stationed myself.&nbsp; Most of the women wore their
distinctive shawl, a scarlet whittle, this being the colour
appropriated by the daughters of Pembrokeshire; while their
Cardiganshire neighbours have adopted the white whittle.&nbsp;
All of them at that time wore high black hats.&nbsp; Lord Cawdor,
as he was riding about inspecting things in general, was struck
by the resemblance of a mass of these women to a body of
regulars, and he called upon the daughters of Cambria to give a
proof of their patriotism by marching towards the enemy in
regular order.&nbsp; The females responded by a considerable
cackle, which, however, signified assent.&nbsp; I saw Jemima and
her niece in the front of the regiment which moved forward boldly
towards <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>the enemy.&nbsp; Ere long a sudden dip in the ground
rendered them invisible to the French, at which place, turning
into a side lane, they came again to the back of the hill whence
they had started, and renewed their former course; it was done
almost in the way in which, I am told, these effects are managed
in a theatre.&nbsp; This man&oelig;uvre caused much laughter
among the spectators, and no little puffing and panting to the
fair sex who accomplished it, many of whom were somewhat stout
and not very young.&nbsp; However, it had the desired
effect.&nbsp; General Tate acknowledged afterwards that they had
been taken for a regiment of regulars, and the French troops
(greatly composed of convicts) utterly lost heart.&nbsp; If they
had but realised that it took a matter of seven days for the news
to travel to London, they need not have distressed themselves on
the score of quick aid from England.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>In
the meantime parties of marauders in a half-drunken state
continued to prowl about the neighbourhood.&nbsp; A considerable
number of militia and peasantry encountered five of these men,
who were dragging with them a young calf.&nbsp; They dropped the
calf and advanced to the combat, while our men, thinking the odds
unfair, singled out five of our sailors (of whom Davy Jones was
one), and Mr. Whitesides, a Liverpool gentleman who assisted, as
a stranger, at the selection, dismissed them to their work with
this benediction:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take time, my boys, and do it well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The French soldiers fired, and one of our men fell, wounded in
the foot; then it was the tars&rsquo; turn, and they fired with
such judgment that three of the enemy lay flat on the ground, and
the remaining two departed rapidly.&nbsp; One of the three proved
to be dead, the other two badly wounded.&nbsp; This <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>encounter
of a few, with a multitude looking on, took one back to the old
days of Arthur&rsquo;s knights, or to the still older days of
Goliath of Gath.</p>
<p>Considerable numbers of Frenchmen were by this time in a very
unpleasing state of body and mind in consequence of rash
indulgence in port wine and poultry boiled in butter.&nbsp; They
were captured in small groups by the peasantry, who laid in wait
for them behind the gorse bushes which abound in this region, and
who jumped out on them with scant ceremony whenever they had a
chance.&nbsp; A man belonging to Llanunda village, taking a
cautious peep through his own little window from the outside,
perceived one of the enemy making free with his food and wine;
the Frenchman was enjoying himself thoroughly, he had made an
excellent fire from most of the furniture, and he was toasting
his legs <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>thereat as he sipped the generous wine with the air of
a connoisseur.&nbsp; This was more than the Taffy could
stand.&nbsp; He had not saved that wine from a wreck at
considerable personal risk to see it sending a glow through the
veins of a foreigner; he flung himself into the room with a
strong expression behind his teeth and a hay-fork clenched
tightly in his hand.&nbsp; The Frenchman jumped up and thrust
with his bayonet at the master of the house, who turned aside the
blow, then, taking the foe on his pitchfork, tossed him into the
fire, as he might have pitched a truss of hay on to the rick.</p>
<p>A party of marauders set forth with the view of plundering
Manorowen, a gentleman&rsquo;s seat in the vicinity; but being
followed by a detachment of the Yeomanry, they returned in a very
different manner from what they had anticipated.</p>
<p>And now we, on our knoll&mdash;and there <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>were some
thousands of us, including peasantry, fishermen, shopkeepers, and
the resident gentry of three counties&mdash;raised a shout of
pride and triumph as Lord Cawdor at the head of his small troop
of Yeomanry Cavalry rode off to inspect the enemy at close
quarters.&nbsp; The sinking sun shone on their glittering
accoutrements and splendid uniforms, and a glow of satisfaction
filled our hearts as we noted the fine chargers they bestrode,
for a Pembrokeshire man loves horseflesh as truly as a Yorkshire
man; and not even my cloth has ever restrained me from being a
genuine Philhippos.&nbsp; The Castle Martin Yeomanry have always
been celebrated for their horses; and indeed it was no matter of
surprise to any one to hear, as we did hear afterwards, that
General Tate mistook these men for the staff surrounding some
English general, the main body of whose troops were defiling
around <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>the side of the mountain; in truth, as the courteous
reader knows, none other than the old women.&nbsp; Lord Cawdor,
at the head of his forty yeoman, trotted close under Carnunda,
the stronghold of the enemy, who could, if they had possessed
guns, have swept them all off the face of the earth.&nbsp; As it
was they narrowly escaped falling into an ambush.&nbsp; A force
of French soldiers were lying in wait for them a little further
up the road, and had Lord Cawdor taken this route, as was his
lordship&rsquo;s first design, his men might have been surprised,
though even in that case we may well believe they would have
given as good as they got.</p>
<p>However, darkness falling suddenly, caused a change of plans;
Lord Cawdor and the reconnoitring party rejoined the main body,
and the British troops took up their quarters for the night in
Fishguard.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL TATE&rsquo;S LETTER.</span></h3>
<p>I also retired to Fishguard in order to calm my mother&rsquo;s
mind about my safety&mdash;and also to get my supper.</p>
<p>My mother was, as mothers are, overjoyed to see me, and gave
me an ample and excellent supper, liberally seasoned with more
hero-worship.&nbsp; I really believe she thought me capable of
facing and fighting the whole French force single-handed, and she
considered that I had guided Ann George through untold dangers
into safety.&nbsp; The other way would have been much nearer the
truth, but she did not see it so.&nbsp; <a

</a></p>
<p>The times were too exciting for a lad of my age to sit with
his toes under the table; my mother, too, was busily engaged in
making preparations to receive the strangers who were quartered
in our house, so as soon as supper was ended I fared forth into
the street again to pick up scraps of intelligence, and try to
find out the latest news.</p>
<p>I was too full of excitement to care to go to bed, and I found
most of my fellow-townsmen were of my mind in this matter.&nbsp;
I turned in first at Jemima Nicholas&rsquo;s house to see how she
and her niece were getting on after their novel experience of
warlike <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>tactics on a large scale.&nbsp; Jemima, an immensely
powerful woman, seemed only sorry that they had not come to close
quarters with the enemy: she was truly a Celtic Amazon who took a
pleasure in fighting for fighting&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Nancy, to my surprise, seemed to have been indulging in the
luxury of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is the matter with you, Nan?&rdquo; I
asked, with unfeeling openness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your eyes are quite
red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy shot a glance of anger at me from the orbs in question,
but vouchsafed no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; interposed Jemima,
&ldquo;that her young man was wounded in the fight up there just
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean Davy Jones?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I knew one of the sailors got shot; but I didn&rsquo;t
know which it was; I never thought of inquiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;You unfeeling young heathen!&rdquo; burst out
Nancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there, it&rsquo;s no good talking; boys
have no more heart than cabbages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cabbage <i>has</i> a heart, Nancy,&rdquo; I
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so&rsquo;ve you&mdash;much the same sort,&rdquo;
cried Ann, too cross for similes or logic.</p>
<p>Very much offended, I got up, but delivered this shaft before
I departed: &ldquo;<i>All</i> those sailors were my friends
equally, so it made no odds to me which of them was
wounded.&nbsp; And how was I to know Davy Jones was your young
man, when it&rsquo;s my belief you didn&rsquo;t know it yourself
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the door slammed abruptly just behind my more backward
leg, and the rest of my remark was cut off.</p>
<p>I wended my way into the main street, and soon found the
centre of attraction to be the old hostelry, the &ldquo;Royal
Oak.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men and boys, and many of the gentler sex also,
<a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>swarmed
round its window and its quaint old porch.&nbsp; The interior was
filled with officers discussing the position of affairs.&nbsp;
With a good deal of trouble and squeezing, and being in those
days of an eel-like figure, I slipped and shoved myself close to
one of the windows, where, balancing on my hands and with my nose
glued to the pane, I inspected all those men of mark, and tried
to find out what their intentions might be.</p>
<p>This position might, affording as it did ample opportunity for
the horse-play of the rude, seem <i>infra dig.</i> to those who
have only known me in my later years; but it must be remembered I
was then but a boy not given to stand on my dignity and strongly
moved by curiosity, or perhaps I might call it by the higher
title&mdash;desire of knowledge.</p>
<p>For a good space there was not much <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>to observe,
save the various uniforms of the gentlemen and their manner of
taking snuff and of laying their hands on their swords.&nbsp; Of
a sudden I felt rather than heard a thrill of excitement in the
crowd behind me: this soon resolved itself into a most
unmistakable pushing and making-way on the part of some, and of
craning forward and tiptoeing on the part of others around
me.</p>
<p>With difficulty I turned my head, and I beheld a most
unexpected sight.&nbsp; Two French officers were striving to make
their way through the hindering, turbulent crowd, the nearer
members of which shrank from them as though they bore with them
the plague, while the more distant ones pressed forward to catch
a sight of these foreigners in the same way that people like to
gaze on the more savage members of a menagerie.&nbsp; This caused
the strange lurch, the ebb and flow in the crowd.&nbsp; But still
the men kept <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>on making for the door of the inn, and no one actually
opposed their passage.</p>
<p>One of them carried in his hand a white flag, and almost
before I could believe the evidence of my eyes&mdash;for the ears
had no work to do, every one being too much astonished to
speak&mdash;the two envoys from the French camp were disappearing
through the entrance and being ushered into the presence of Lord
Cawdor and his officers.</p>
<p>Now I had reason to be proud of my &rsquo;vantage-place.&nbsp;
Once more my face was pressed, with considerable outside pressure
indeed, against the pane, and I saw with my own eyes that French
aide-de-camp, Monsieur Leonard, present, with many a bow and
flourish, the written communication from his general to Lord
Cawdor.&nbsp; At the sight of those grimaces the crowd around me
awoke from their trance of astonished silence&mdash;from the
absolute stupefaction which had <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>possessed them as it had possessed
me.&nbsp; Consciousness and speech returned to them, and took the
outward form of maledictions.</p>
<p>I, however, was more interested in watching the demeanour of
the gentlemen within than of my fellow-townsmen without the
house.&nbsp; His lordship, though his back was not so supple as
the Frenchman&rsquo;s, still received the letter with every mark
of good breeding; and after a few formalities opened the
communication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark all they do!&rdquo; I whispered to one of my
rib-bending neighbours, who, being of a higher class and better
parts than the rest, I imagined would understand me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mark it well, Mr. Evans, for this is how History is
made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;History!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Evans, blankly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;History happened long ago; this is only to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hst!&rdquo; said the crowd.</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>In
fact, Lord Cawdor had now commenced to read the letter aloud to
his officers.&nbsp; It was, happily for us outsiders, and perhaps
even for some of the gentlemen within, in English; for the leader
of the invaders, being an Irishman, probably understood English
at least as well as French, while most of us understood it a good
deal better.&nbsp; The letter was short: it was briefly a
proposal for the surrender of the entire French force, on
conditions.&nbsp; As I had subsequently the privilege of seeing
it, I give here the actual words of the letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cardigan Bay</span>,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;5<i>th</i> <i>Ventose</i>,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;5<i>th</i> <i>Year of the Republic</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The circumstances
under which the body of troops under my command were landed at
this place render it unnecessary to attempt any military
operations, as they <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>would tend only to bloodshed and
pillage.&nbsp; The officers of the whole corps have, therefore,
intimated their desire of entering into a negotiation, upon
principles of humanity, for a surrender.&nbsp; If you are
influenced by similar considerations, you may signify the same to
the bearer, and in the meantime hostilities shall cease.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Health and respect,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Tate</span>, <i>Chef de
Brigade</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Cawdor, however, did not signify the same to the bearer,
but a slight smile lit up his features, while the French officers
went on to explain that they were ready to capitulate on
condition that they should be sent back to Brest at the expense
of the English Government.&nbsp; A low murmur broke out among the
onlookers.&nbsp; The Frenchmen&rsquo;s ships had deserted them
and they wanted us to give them a free passage home.&nbsp; <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>But Colonel
Knox had something to say to that.&nbsp; The uncertain light of
lanterns and candles (mostly dips, for the resources of the
&ldquo;Royal Oak&rdquo; and, indeed, of Fishguard, were limited)
fell on his white hair and handsome uniform, flickering on the
gold of the embroideries, and no one but those who knew would
have believed that his fancy was as brilliant as that glittering
braid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have ten thousand men now in Fishguard,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;ten thousand more are on the road.&nbsp; Unconditional
surrender are our only terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messengers looked very blank when they understood the
tenour of these words, but they appeared still more impressed
when Lord Cawdor in a stern voice, but with his usual courtesy of
manner, gave them an answer.&nbsp; He informed them that he
should at once write an answer to General Tate, which he should
send to him in the morning, <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>but that they might tell him in the
meantime that his troops would be expected to parade for
surrender on the following day.</p>
<p>His lordship, who had hitherto been standing, sat down and
consulted for a few moments in an undertone with some of his
suite.&nbsp; Then taking up a pen, he quickly wrote an answer,
dusted sand over it to dry the ink, and standing up once more he
read it aloud in clear and ringing tones.&nbsp; It commanded the
admiration and approbation of all present on both sides of the
window, except perhaps of the aide-de-camp and his fellow, who
probably did not understand the English tongue, and if they had
would not perchance have admired the style of the
composition.&nbsp; We did, however&mdash;that is, those of the
crowd who heard it&mdash;and the rest taking it on trust, we
signified our approval by three cheers, delivered with <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>excellent
intention, but in the usual disjointed Welsh fashion.</p>
<p>Lord Cawdor merely remarked in his letter that with his
superior force (save the mark!&mdash;and the old women!) he would
accept of no terms except the unconditional surrender of the
whole French force as prisoners of war.&nbsp; And that he
expected an answer with all speed, this being his ultimatum:
Major Ackland would present himself at the camp at Trehowel early
on the following morning to receive this answer, for which Lord
Cawdor would not wait later than ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>These were the actual words of the letter which was delivered
on the following morning at Trehowel to General Tate and six
hundred Frenchmen, drawn up in line, by his lordship&rsquo;s
aide-de-camp, the Hon. Captain Edwardes, his white flag of truce
being carried by Mr. Millingchamp.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fishguard</span>,
<i>Feb.</i> 23<i>rd.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The superiority
of the force under my command, which is hourly increasing, must
prevent my treating upon any other terms short of your
surrendering your whole force prisoners of war.&nbsp; I enter
fully into your wish of preventing an unnecessary effusion of
blood, which your speedy surrender can alone prevent, and which
will entitle you to that consideration it is ever the wish of
British troops to show an enemy whose numbers are inferior.&nbsp;
My major will deliver you this letter, and I shall expect your
determination by 10 o&rsquo;clock, by your officer, whom I have
furnished with an escort who will conduct him to me without
molestation.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am, &amp;c.,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cawdor</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The major referred to was Major Ackland <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>who
accompanied Captain Edwardes to Trehowel.</p>
<p>We thought it very fine&mdash;and so it was; and the words we
didn&rsquo;t understand we thought the finest.&nbsp; After this
the French envoys were dismissed, with their white flag still
grasped firmly.&nbsp; They were also provided with a strong
escort to take them back safely to their own lines, and indeed
they required it, for by this time we had quite wakened up; and
as the two men were led forth from the inn blindfolded with thick
shawls lest they should spy the poverty of the force, we greeted
them with a yell which must have made their hearts shake.&nbsp;
My countrymen are beyond all comparison better at yelling than at
cheering; it was cowardly no doubt of it, considering the
difference of our numbers; but when was a mob anything but
cowardly?</p>
<p>Of course to a boy it was pure delight, and <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>my
enjoyment that evening made up for the cramp of the night
before.&nbsp; The escort kept us at more than arm&rsquo;s length,
but no friendly force could have kept us from running after these
representatives of the enemy, or from shouting at them, or even
from throwing a few stones and sticks at them.&nbsp; The men
remembered the wine and brandy, the women the slaughtered ducks
and geese, and they hurled stones and curses mixed at the two
devourers we could get at.&nbsp; The escort certainly received
the brunt of the battle and most of the stones, and sent back
many objurations at us in return; but we were too hurried to
discriminate friend from foe.</p>
<p>We ran as far as a place called Windy Hall, <a
name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154"
class="citation">[154]</a> from whence there is a wide-stretching
view of Goodwick Sands and the most <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>perfectly-exposed down-hill slope
that could possibly be desired for the final volley of stones
with which we wished them goodnight.</p>
<p>I was pretty well tired out by this time, so returned home to
see how my parents fared in these strange days, and to have a
second supper, and then to bed in my own particular little den,
which usually I had only the felicity of occupying in the
holidays: and so the Thursday came to an end.</p>
<h2><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<i>THE THIRD DAY</i>.</h2>
<h3><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GATHERING AT GOODWICK.</span></h3>
<p>Nor many hours did the little den hold me after all, for in
the early morning I woke with the feeling that something strange
was astir.&nbsp; Then came a vague terror&mdash;the memory of my
yester-morn&rsquo;s awakening, and then a sense of jubilant
triumph as I recalled the Frenchmen&rsquo;s offer and the stout
answer of our chief.&nbsp; Surely they would capitulate now
without more talking or more fighting.&nbsp; I should have liked
to have witnessed a little fighting well enough&mdash;from a
distance.&nbsp; But then a fight is a very uncertain thing, it
twirls about so, you never know where it <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>will get to
next, or where you are sure to be in it, or still more, safe to
be out of it.</p>
<p>The men quartered in our house were astir early, and perhaps
their heavy footfalls had more to do with rousing me than my own
excitability.&nbsp; Still quick-silver seemed to be running about
all over me as I hastily swallowed my breakfast&mdash;which,
however, I did full justice to&mdash;and then rushed out of the
house to join everybody else on the road to Goodwick.&nbsp; What
a throng there was!&nbsp; Every man, woman, and child in
Fishguard and all the country round seemed to have turned out,
and to be making for the great sands at Goodwick.&nbsp; The
people gathered from every direction, east, west, and south,
until the semi-circle of hills was dark with them.&nbsp; Chiefly,
however, the throng came from the east and south, for Trehowel
lay to the west, and there were but few of the natives left in
that direction; besides which the steep white <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>road that
mounts the hill on that side of the sands was left clear for the
descent of the enemy.&nbsp; No one wished to interfere with them
needlessly; quite the contrary: at all events, till they had got
within reach of our trained men.&nbsp; In the meantime we would
give them a wide berth lest they should turn and rend us.</p>
<p>Suddenly a wild voice and a wild figure smote our
senses&mdash;both eyes and ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dream, the dream!&rdquo; it yelled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The dream is coming true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dream?&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo; asked every one,
but there were more askers than answerers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your ears and listen!&rdquo; continued the wild
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Use your eyes and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever is he, Jemima?&rdquo; I asked, finding myself
near a reliable woman.&nbsp; Nancy stood some little way off
leaning against a cart.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s old Enoch Lale,&rdquo; said
Jemima.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know him well enough, he lives over there
under Trehowel, by Carreg Gwastad, just where these blacks
landed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why Jemima always persisted in calling the French
&ldquo;blacks,&rdquo; I know not; possibly because they were
foreigners, possibly she meant blackguards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dream!&nbsp; I told it to ye, unbelieving race, aye,
thirty years ago!&rdquo; yelled the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed, that&rsquo;s true for him,&rdquo; remarked
Jemima.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard him tell it many a time, years and
years ago.&nbsp; Well, I always thought he was soft, but now he
seems real raving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty years ago I had the vision, and you know it, men
and neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, true for you, Enoch Lale,&rdquo; answered
many a voice in the crowd; chiefly this response came from
elderly persons <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>who had doubtless heard the tale many a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t heard it.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t born
then,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>Whether Enoch Lale heard this gentle protest, or whether he
was resolved not to be baulked of his story, I cannot say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I only know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I had a vision of
the night, and the future was revealed to me in a dream; yea, and
more than a dream, for I rose up out of my bed and went down on
to the rocks and there&mdash;on Carreg Gwastad&mdash;the French
troops landed, and I saw them&mdash;aye, as plain as ever any of
you saw them two days ago.&nbsp; And that was thirty years ago,
yet it has come true!&nbsp; But wait, and listen! and ye shall
hear the brass drums sounding, as I heard them sound that
night!&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp; Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down off that cart and be quiet, Enoch Lale, or
you&rsquo;ll be having a fit.&nbsp; We <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>all know,
you&rsquo;ve told your dream often enough; why you woke me up
that very night to tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the prophet was taken possession of by a quiet elderly
woman, his better half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we got rid of old I-told-you-so rather
suddenly,&rdquo; I observed to Jemima.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is
very queer about his dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a many things,&rdquo; replied Jemima,
&ldquo;as we don&rsquo;t know nothing about&mdash;and dreams is
one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was marvellous to watch the gathering of troops and
people.&nbsp; The hills to the south of the bay were covered with
peasant men, and the red-whittled women who had done such good
service to their country, and whose conduct has never been
rewarded by any faintest token of gratitude or even of
recognition by that country.</p>
<p>At the foot of these hills came a marsh, bounded by a road on
the other side of which <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>were the famous sands&mdash;where
were stationed in a compact body the Castle Martin Yeomanry
Cavalry.&nbsp; Ere long these men were drawn out of their trim
ranks for a difficult and dangerous duty; but of that anon.</p>
<p>The infantry was drawn up in a field on the east side of the
bay, just under Windy Hill, to which farm the field
belonged.&nbsp; The force consisted of the Cardiganshire and
Pembrokeshire Volunteers&mdash;about three hundred strong:
together with the Fishguard Fencibles.&nbsp; Numerically weak we
were indeed, but on our own ground and with right on our
side.&nbsp; Added to which we had had the pleasing news of the
enemy&rsquo;s faint-heartedness: so that altogether we felt
ourselves animated by the courage of lions.</p>
<p>Major Ackland had had his promised interview with General Tate
in the early morning at the French headquarters in the old house
of Trehowel.&nbsp; The interview had <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>been a short one, and much to the
point; he declined altogether to parley, or parlez-vous.&nbsp; He
insisted on instant and unconditional surrender; then sticking
spurs in his horse he galloped away without any compliments.</p>
<p>Lord Cawdor and his staff were riding up and down the sands
when the gallant Major appeared bringing the glorious news that
the French were coming, and at once, and that they were prepared
to surrender at discretion.&nbsp; But the Colonel still continued
his work of inspecting the whole of the British troops.&nbsp; He
still thought, perhaps hoped, that there might be a passage of
arms.</p>
<p>Then came a time of deep silence when each individual among us
concentrated his senses in his ears.&nbsp; I, being but a boy,
allowed my eyes a little freedom; most other eyes were
concentrated on the road where the French would first appear, but
I <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>permitted mine to gaze around me, when I at once made a
discovery.&nbsp; The cart against which Nancy had leant contained
a man, the outline of the back of whose head seemed strangely
familiar to me.&nbsp; I could only see the back of his head for
he was leaning out of the cart with his face turned away from me,
but towards another person who was standing on the other side of
the cart.&nbsp; Some bushes, behind which the cart had been drawn
up, prevented a clear view, so I shifted my position a
little&mdash;in fact, went straight up to the group, who seemed
to be placing rather a blind confidence in their retired
situation, and in the magnetic attraction of the enemy.&nbsp; I
rounded the cart; the young man was, as I had imagined, Davy
Jones, wounded foot and all; the young woman was, as I had
guessed, Nancy George.&nbsp; Their heads were very near together,
perhaps they were talking about splints.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;Why, Nancy!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;is that
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course it is, Master Dan&mdash;and why
shouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo; cried Nancy, as red as a
turkey-cock, and as inclined to show fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right.&nbsp; I only thought you must be
somebody else,&rdquo; I returned, politely.</p>
<p>Davy broke into a roar of laughter, and Ann, in spite of her
indignation, showed her row of white teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, you tiresome boy, and look out for the
French,&rdquo; was her recommendation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not for the&mdash;&rdquo; but my sentence was cut
short by a shove from Nan&rsquo;s vigorous arm which sent me
flying for some paces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of the spoons, Ann!&rdquo; was my parting
shot, as I made my way a little further down the hill.</p>
<p>We all sat down on the ferny slopes and <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>waited and
listened.&nbsp; As a general rule nobody talked, which showed how
grave was the occasion.&nbsp; In front of us was the sea dark
grey to-day as was the sky; the sands sometimes almost golden,
were, on this dull February day, only another shade of grey; and
the great boulders of rock which cropped up everywhere were of
the same colour.&nbsp; And this greyness seemed to suit this
scene better than the brightness of Wednesday would have done;
for though it was a day of triumph to us we could not forget that
it was a day of humiliation and bitterness to these hundreds of
men who were approaching us on the other side of the hill.&nbsp;
The tide was coming in, but without any sparkle and dash,
sullenly; and the south-west wind blew in gusts the strength of
which told plainly of power in reserve: one could feel that it
was capable of violence.</p>
<p>So were the people who sat <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>waiting&mdash;apparently
quietly&mdash;for their enemies, on the hill-slope, which rose
into a natural amphitheatre on all sides (save one) of the scene:
whereof the flat sands formed the arena or floor.&nbsp; What a
place this would have been for one of the old Roman shows; for a
moment I seemed to see the gladiators struggling for life or
death, to hear the cruel roar of the lions, to watch the
fighting, tearing, and rending in the arena, and to witness what
struck me most with awe&mdash;the fierce lust for blood which
filled the spectators, one and all, as they shouted and craved
for more&mdash;more blood.&nbsp; I woke up suddenly with a start
to find I had been dozing on the hillside, where the people were
sitting quietly enough, Britons not Romans, perhaps some of them
descendants of these very gladiators who had been</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Butchered to make a Roman
holiday.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CAPITULATION.</span></h3>
<p>Suddenly the listening people caught a far-off sound; it came
nearer and nearer rapidly, one&rsquo;s ears seem to go out to
meet it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; came in a hoarse growl from
hundreds of guttural throats&mdash;speaking of course in
Welsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hst,&rdquo; came the return growl from the other
portion of the crowd.</p>
<p>The sound became louder and louder; it was plainly the beating
of brass drums.&nbsp; A sort of thrill&mdash;sometimes called
goose-skin passed over me, and I doubt not over most of my
neighbours.&nbsp; Enoch Lale&rsquo;s dream was <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>the thought
that stirred us; there was something of second-sight about it
that awed one even in the morning air and among that crowd of
living beings.&nbsp; For a minute I saw again the spectral army
of Enoch&rsquo;s vision.&nbsp; Then, being a boy, the practical
aspect of the matter struck me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the wife hasn&rsquo;t taken the poor old fellow
out of ear-shot,&rdquo; I observed to Mr. Mortimer, near whom I
had placed myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He heard those drums thirty years
ago, sir&mdash;and he&rsquo;d like to know he was
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, most of us do,&rdquo; assented Mr.
Mortimer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Enoch&rsquo;s somewhere about, never
fear.&nbsp; Hush, my boy, look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All our senses were focussed in our eyes, something shining
and moving we saw, and what could that be save the bayonets of
the enemy?&nbsp; Still the shrill clanging of the brass drums
went on, broken only by the thud of the sea breaking upon the
sand.&nbsp; Every head <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>was turned towards the west (even
Nancy&rsquo;s and Davy&rsquo;s for I looked to see) towards the
rocky stronghold of Carnunda, past the houses and trees of
Goodwick, all along the white road which runs like a riband
placed aslant on the hill-side.</p>
<p>The glittering points turned the corner and came into full
view; it was at exactly two o&rsquo;clock that the first of the
Frenchmen appeared in sight.&nbsp; On they came, a moving mass of
dark blue, carrying no colours, neither gay tricolor nor white
flag of peace, but beating their drums so as to put a good face
on the matter.&nbsp; A moment later this was changed.</p>
<p>As the column rounded the corner of the road, our hills
suddenly started into life and their silence was broken by a
prolonged yell so fierce and threatening that the French recoiled
and then halted.&nbsp; I could not, even at the moment, blame
them; there seemed <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>every probability that they would be massacred.&nbsp;
The Welsh had jumped to their feet as with one bound, and they
were making up for their long silence now, the men all
brandishing every conceivable kind of weapon, the women shaking
their fists at the invaders and screeching at them at the top of
their voices.&nbsp; I had only a pocket-knife about me and
concluded to keep that for my bread and cheese, of which I was
badly in want at this moment.</p>
<p>Jemima Nicholas dashed past me, rushing down the hill at full
speed with a pitchfork in her hands, followed by some other
war-like women of her stamp&mdash;some of them armed with
straightened scythes.&nbsp; I got out of their way quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come on, my daughters!&rdquo; yelled the fierce
cobbler&mdash;for that was her trade&mdash;&ldquo;come on and cut
them down into the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that she certainly <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>wished to
do it, indeed, there was a manifest disposition on the part of
the peasantry, male and female, to come at once to close quarters
with the enemy.&nbsp; Then rushed a sudden thunder of hoofs along
the shore, as Lord Cawdor and his yeomanry galloped in front of
the angry people, ordering them back and impressing their
commands with the flat of their drawn swords.</p>
<p>Strong guards were also posted in every path that led from the
hills to the sands, while the road on which the French were now
meditating a hasty retreat was especially strongly guarded by
detachments of the Cardiganshire Militia and the Fishguard
Fencibles.&nbsp; At last, seeing these precautions against
popular fury and that no sudden violence was now likely to occur,
the French once more took heart and resumed their downward march
and drums.&nbsp; They were accompanied by Lord Cawdor&rsquo;s
aide-de-camp, <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>the Hon. Captain Edwardes, and by Mr. Millingchamp, who
bore a large white flag of truce; these had already given the
order to &ldquo;open pans and shed priming&rdquo; and to march on
peaceably: and they were obeyed.</p>
<p>Colonel Colby marched his men down from Windy Hill, and as he
passed the spot where I was, I heard him say, &ldquo;Let us all
be ready, my boys, perhaps they may disappoint us
still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the gallant colonel&rsquo;s hopes of a fight were doomed
to be unfulfilled&mdash;and so were Jemima&rsquo;s&mdash;the
French troops were thoroughly demoralised and had no fight in
them.&nbsp; They marched on to the sands in columns, halted
before Lord Cawdor and his staff backed by a handful of men (for
most of our troops were employed in keeping back the excited
populace), and then quietly laid down their arms and marched
on.</p>
<p>When they had thus deposited their old <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>flint guns
some of them looked around them.&nbsp; It is impossible to
describe the chagrin depicted on their features when they
realised how trifling (numerically speaking) was the force to
which they had succumbed.&nbsp; Still greater was the annoyance
they experienced when they discovered that the scarlet flash
which had so scared them was produced&mdash;not by the red coats
of a body of regulars&mdash;but by the whittles worn by a parcel
of women!&nbsp; These individuals now allowed the fallen foe to
have a near view of their tall hats and scarlet mantles, for
dashing down the hills on to the sands in spite of the guards
(who were indeed too much occupied in looking after the piles of
muskets to heed minor matters) these bellicose dames and damsels
gathered closely around the Frenchmen, addressing manifold
observations to them in their Welsh tongue, in the use of which
most of them possess extraordinary fluency.</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>But
their Gallican sisters also can talk and scold.&nbsp; I had by
this time got very near to the unlucky commander of the
expedition, General Tate; and I was close by when Madame Tate who
had accompanied the troops flew at him like a fury.&nbsp; She,
too, had discovered the paucity of our numbers, and that Lord
Cawdor&rsquo;s &ldquo;ten thousand men&rdquo; were&mdash;in Spain
perhaps&mdash;and that the English regulars were&mdash;well, very
irregular forces attired in scarlet whittles.&nbsp; Her remarks
as to the conduct of the campaign were evidently of a most
uncomplimentary nature; though I cannot say I understood French,
I understood that.&nbsp; In my heart I felt sorry for General
Tate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, mum,&rdquo; I ventured to remark, &ldquo;if
you want to have it out with somebody, here&rsquo;s a lady of
your own weight and age.&nbsp; Tackle Jemima.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Tate, though understanding <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>never a word, turned furiously on
Jemima, who returned the shower of epithets.&nbsp; The General,
giving me a look of pure gratitude, hastened away, and I followed
his example.</p>
<p>The troops were marched away in columns by fours, and, guarded
by our men, set off at once for their various
destinations&mdash;chiefly gaols; our bands now taking up the
strain and making the welkin ring with joyous airs, to which we
added all our lungs&rsquo; strength of voice in songs and
cheers.</p>
<p>So ended the famous capitulation of the French on Goodwick
Sands.</p>
<h3><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<span class="GutSmall">TREHOWEL ONCE MORE.</span></h3>
<p>We could still hear the festive strains of &ldquo;The Girl I
Left Behind Me,&rdquo;&mdash;every road was full of
soldiers&mdash;guards and guarded, some on their way to
Haverfordwest, some to Milford, some to Carmarthen, some, for the
present, only as far as Fishguard.&nbsp; Their number (sixteen
hundred, without stragglers who dropped in later) taxed the
resources of this thinly inhabited country to the uttermost, both
as regarded the food and the housing of their prisoners.&nbsp;
Vast relief was felt when the greater number of them were shipped
off to the place from whence they came.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>&ldquo;Where are you going, master?&rdquo; asked Ann
George, coming up to Mr. Mortimer as he was moving away, having
now beheld the end of this strange scene of the bloodless
surrender of sixteen hundred men to a very insignificant force;
surely one of the strangest sights ever witnessed on the shores
of this happy island.</p>
<p>Nancy had taken no part in the action of her aunt Jemima; she
was not the woman to jeer a fallen foe, so she had remained
quietly by the cart till all was over, then had turned to her
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, master?&rdquo; asked the faithful
servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to my own house; for I suppose it is mine again
now,&rdquo; said he, with a sort of groan as he thought of the
manner in which the old home had been desecrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come too,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;the
place is bound to be topsy-turvy, sir, and a <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>gentleman
can&rsquo;t do aught to straighten it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not, Nancy, there are a lot of drunken vagabonds
about still&mdash;too drunk to know they&rsquo;ve
capitulated.&nbsp; And some of the officers who were afraid to
trust to the white flag and our word are at Trehowel
still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Nancy was not to be put off so; she would go.&nbsp;
She had been in service for some years at Trehowel and she
considered that the kitchen belonged to her, and it went to her
heart to think of the damage done.&nbsp; She could have no peace
till she could begin to repair it, and to set things once more in
order to receive home the bride, as now the strangely postponed
wedding would surely take place.</p>
<p>Davy Jones went too&mdash;I suppose because Nancy did; they
seemed great friends now, though previously the young woman had
<a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>been in
the habit of giving him the cold shoulder, I imagine because of
his habit of smuggling; but I did not take much interest in the
matter as a boy, not understanding the fair sex; indeed, even in
after years I doubt if I ever quite succeeded in fathoming their
method of reasoning.&nbsp; However, it is quite certain that as
Nancy permitted it Davy was quite content to go wherever she did,
and he gave her and me also a seat in his cart.&nbsp; I went too,
for I thought that if there was anything to be seen I might as
well see it; and I had heard that General Tate had gone back
there after the surrender&mdash;on parole.&nbsp; I had some
curiosity to see him again, and I thought it due to myself to
witness the end of this affair, of which I had chanced to see the
very beginning.</p>
<p>As we went up the steep hill from Goodwick, we were joined by
a party of the Fishguard Fencibles, sent to look after the <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>scattered
inebriates, and to take the swords and words of the retiring
French officers.&nbsp; When we got to Brestgarn we encountered
the grinning face of Llewellyn, about whom Nancy and I had had
many an uneasy thought.&nbsp; He told us that his captors had not
ill-treated him beyond making him work for them, that they had
kept a sharp eye on him for a day and two nights and then he had
managed to escape.&nbsp; He had hidden for a while, but as soon
as possible had returned to look after his master&rsquo;s
goods.&nbsp; Llewellyn was a very ordinary looking man with
unpolished&mdash;even uncouth manners, but it struck me that he
had a stronger sense of duty than is usual.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p184.jpg">
<img alt=
"Trehowel: General Tate&rsquo;s Headquarters"

"Trehowel: General Tate&rsquo;s Headquarters"
src="images/p184.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A few steps further brought us to Trehowel.&nbsp; Out rushed
all the dogs, barking, jumping, tail-wagging&mdash;absolutely
wild with delight at the recovery of their own master.&nbsp; A
grey-haired gentleman came <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>forward and addressed Mr. Mortimer
with much courtesy&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, the dogs know you.&nbsp; I presume you are the
master here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so once.&nbsp; Down, Gelert!&nbsp; Quiet,
Corg&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer then introduced himself to Mr. Mortimer as General
Tate.&nbsp; He went on to say that he had understood that the
Welsh people were ripe for revolt and that they might march
throughout Wales and even a good deal further with wooden
swords.&nbsp; That it had been a great disappointment to him to
find this was not the case, that it had also been a source of
annoyance to him to be deserted by his ships, but that the most
unpleasant sensation he had ever experienced had been the failing
of heart he had felt as his foot touched Welsh soil.</p>
<p>I listened with all my ears to this interesting discourse,
which happily I was able to <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>understand, for General Tate being
an Irishman spoke English perfectly.</p>
<p>Our attention was diverted by a cry&mdash;a cry of surprise
which broke from Nancy with a suddenness which startled all of
us.&nbsp; We all turned hastily round and beheld the girl
standing as if petrified, with her arm stretched out and her hand
pointing towards a man who stood a few yards from
her&mdash;apparently one of the stragglers among the French
soldiers, for he was clothed in the same way as the majority of
them&mdash;a British soldier&rsquo;s uniform which had been dyed
a rusty brown.&nbsp; The man looked dumb-foundered but Nancy
found her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is you, James Bowen, who have betrayed your own
people to strangers.&nbsp; Uch a fi, traitor; I could strike you
where you stand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I do it for you, Nancy?&rdquo; suggested Davy,
ready to hobble out of the cart.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;No, he is not worth it.&nbsp; Let him go to gaol
with his friends,&rdquo; said Nancy, scornfully.</p>
<p>James Bowen looked utterly bewildered; he had evidently been
drinking heavily and had not even heard of the surrender; had he
done so he would hardly have come back to Trehowel, but would
have made off into the interior.&nbsp; But Nancy&rsquo;s contempt
roused him somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your own fault,&rdquo; he said, sullenly,
&ldquo;you drove me away from here, you drove me to the
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose I drove you to steal a horse and then to
break out of gaol, and to run off to France, and to fetch back
foreigners here&mdash;showing them the entrance to Carreg Gwastad
Creek!&nbsp; I helped in that too, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t pretend to be so particular,
you&rsquo;ve taken up with a smuggler yourself,&rdquo; growled
James.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>Nancy&rsquo;s face flamed, but she took a step nearer
to Davy and placed her hand in his defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is truth indeed, and I&rsquo;m going to marry him
too, for if he is a smuggler, he is an honest boy and isn&rsquo;t
a traitor.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have thought nothing of the horse or
the gaol&mdash;but to betray your own people to
strangers&mdash;let me get out of the sight of you.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Cursed for ever and throughout all ages be the
traitor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this vigorous denunciation of a crime so utterly
hateful to the Welsh people, that they even abhor giving evidence
in a court of justice, Nancy turned her back on the traitor at
once and for ever, and hastily entering her domain at Trehowel,
proceeded to restore the silver spoons to their own place.</p>
<p>The kindly dusk hid much of the damage that had been done; and
after three days&rsquo; <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>absence, at the same hour as when
she had quitted it, Nancy George was restored to the sovereignty
of the kitchen at Trehowel.</p>
<p>And so ended in gladness of heart and rejoicing, Friday the
24th day of February, 1797; and so ended in pain and tribulation
to themselves the three days&rsquo; invasion of the French at
Fishguard.</p>

<i>THE GOLDEN PRISON AT PEMBROKE</i>.</h2>
<h3><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GENERAL THANKSGIVING.</span></h3>
<p>As I have already mentioned, some of the prisoners were sent
to Haverfordwest Gaol&mdash;which, being situated in the old
castle, was a commodious and roomy resort; others were placed,
temporarily, in the churches of St. Mary, St. Thomas, and St.
Martin: others again were sent to Carmarthen, under the escort of
the Romney Fencible Cavalry, the officers being conveyed on
horseback and allowed their parole; but the greater part of the
French force finally found themselves confined in the Golden
Prison at Pembroke.&nbsp; They were taken there and <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>also to
Milford by water; and not a few died on board the vessels, being
closely shut up under deck.&nbsp; Finally, five hundred of them
were safely landed and incarcerated in the Golden Prison, the
state of which, with all this overcrowding, could hardly have
been so delightful as its name might lead the imaginative to
suppose.</p>
<p>Here we will leave them for awhile, returning once more to
myself and my own belongings.&nbsp; My kind mother would not let
me return at once to my master at St. David&rsquo;s, she looked
upon me as &ldquo;her miraculously preserved boy,&rdquo; and must
keep me for a bit to gloat her eyes upon.&nbsp; My father, being
a man who loved a quiet life, consented.&nbsp; And so I was still
in Fishguard when the Royal Proclamation came down, which
commanded us to set aside a day of general thanksgiving for our
preservation from the dangers which threatened our <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>beloved
country.&nbsp; This command reached us about a fortnight after
the danger had passed, posts being rather slow in those
days.&nbsp; Indeed, had we had to wait so long for more
substantial help, we had been in parlous straights long
since.&nbsp; However, &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends
well&rdquo;&mdash;and we had fared through, by the aid of
Providence, our own exertions, and the brandy-laden wrecks.</p>
<p>So we all repaired to our several parish churches; my mother
hanging proudly on my arm, and regarding me as one to be
specially thanked for.&nbsp; Indeed, I was not ill-pleased myself
to perceive some nods of heads and pointings of fingers among the
old crones and young maids as we passed along.&nbsp; This feeling
seemed also to actuate Davy Jones, who limped along arm in arm
with Nancy; she, even then not assuming the dependent position,
but giving him her arm, as it were, in order to help him
along.&nbsp; <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>She even explained to us that, it being her
&ldquo;Sunday out&rdquo; she had come all the way from Trehowel
for this purpose.&nbsp; I may own that I distrusted that limp of
Davy&rsquo;s; it struck me he liked to play the maimed hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Davy,&rdquo; I remarked, very audibly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I saw you at market on Friday, and you weren&rsquo;t
limping a bit.&nbsp; Do you want to have the old women to look at
you or Nancy&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To arm me?&rdquo; said Davy, with a wink.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, my boy.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the old women
to me?&nbsp; But Nancy&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Nancy stopped the dialogue by dragging her admirer
forward in a most hasty manner, with but slight regard for his
wounded limb.&nbsp; The service proceeded as usual.&nbsp; The
hymns occasionally tailed off into one voice which quivered and
sank, dying out into silence; for as it was well known that the
parson&rsquo;s daughter received <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>a shilling from her sire for
pitching up the tune again every time it died a natural death, no
one liked to be so crooked as not to assist nature when the
melody became weak and low.&nbsp; Then the clear young voice came
forth and we started afresh.&nbsp; I need hardly say there was no
instrumental music.</p>
<p>We proceeded, then, in spite of the special occasion in much
our usual manner, leaving most of the thanksgiving to parson and
clerk, and lolling about at our ease thinking of nothing, when
attention! we heard galloping hoofs along the street, which ran
outside the church.&nbsp; At the gate, the horse was suddenly
reined up on his haunches&mdash;a man flung himself off heavily,
and quick feet came tearing up the path to the porch.&nbsp; In an
instant every man, woman, and child in the church stood upright,
ready for fight or flight.</p>
<p>The door burst open, and the express <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>messenger
rushed in, booted, spurred, and breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The French! the French!&rdquo; was all that he could
gasp.&nbsp; He was surrounded in an instant by eager questioners,
his voice was drowned in a very Babel of noise.</p>
<p>Our worthy divine then assumed command of his
congregation.&nbsp; He despatched the clerk to the vestry for a
drop of brandy, and then standing square and upright in the
pulpit he commanded the people to be quiet, and to allow the man
to come unhindered into the pulpit, from where he would himself
announce the news.&nbsp; These orders were obeyed, and John Jones
having returned with the spirit, the parson administered it, and
then desired the man to deliver his message.</p>
<p>It was briefly this; sundry large ships of war, filled with
French troops, were making their way up St. George&rsquo;s
Channel straight for the port of Fishguard.</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>In an
instant the cry rang through the church&mdash;&ldquo;To arms! to
arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then what a scene of confusion arose, fury, dismay, oaths and
shrieks all mingled together, some women fainting, some in tears,
the men roused and excited to the uttermost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, don&rsquo;t go, my son,&rdquo; sobbed
my mother; but curiosity overcame prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to fight, mother, never fear, but I
must go and look on,&rdquo; was my answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Dio, not again, not again!&rdquo; urged Nancy,
thinking of the single combats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to walk across the sea to tackle a
frigate, I promise you,&rdquo; said Davy, with a laugh.&nbsp; But
Nancy was not to be put off so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, come.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m coming too,&rdquo; she
said, and in another instant they were without the church door,
where, indeed, we all <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>found ourselves shortly.&nbsp; We
tore down to the cliffs as the possessed swine might have raced;
many of us ran to man the fort, but I remained on the higher
ground where I could have a better view and see further out to
sea.</p>
<p>And soon there was indeed a fair sight to see.&nbsp; Coming
round the headland to the west of us, their sails filled with the
brisk March breeze, appeared a stately squadron moving proudly
under British colours; but having seen something like this
before, some of us still doubted.&nbsp; The fort saluted, and
this compliment was returned by the men-of-war without any
changing of colours.&nbsp; We began to feel reassured, and soon
our hopes were verified.&nbsp; A boat put off from the nearest
ship and was rowed to shore in a style that swore to
&ldquo;British tar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The officer landed and explained
that the squadron was part of the Channel Fleet, sent <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>to our
assistance, and that it was under the command of the brave Sir
Edward Pellew.&nbsp; We were very proud of the help rendered us
by England, even though it had come a little late, but that was
the fault of our roads not their goodwill; and though it had
occasioned a worse scare than the real thing, but that was only
our disordered nerves which acted up to the old
proverb&mdash;&ldquo;A burnt child dreads fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer inquired very particularly as to the probable
whereabouts of the French ships&mdash;the three frigates and the
lugger.&nbsp; About this we could give him no information
whatever.&nbsp; All we could say was, that the French left their
anchorage at Carreg Gwastad on Thursday, the 23rd of February, at
noon, and took a course directly across the channel towards the
coast of Ireland.&nbsp; Our little sloops did not care to venture
too near since one of them, the <i>Britannia</i>, had <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>been taken
by the enemy, the cargo appropriated, and the sloop scuttled and
sunk.&nbsp; They were, on the whole, persons to whom it was
pleasanter to give a wide berth.</p>
<p>We heard afterwards that one of the ships struck on the Arklow
Banks, she was much injured and lost her rudder; one of her
companions took her in tow and made for France.&nbsp; They got as
far as just off Brest, and then, in sight of home, cruel fate
overtook them in the shape of two English ships, respectively
under the commands of Sir H. B. Neale and of Captain Cooke.&nbsp;
These two made short work of the Frenchmen, both ships were taken
and brought over to Portsmouth, where they were repaired,
commissioned in the British service, and sent to fight our
battles, one of them&mdash;oh glory for our little
town&mdash;bearing henceforth the name of &ldquo;<i>The
Fishguard</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remaining frigate, accompanied by <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>the lugger,
got safely into Brest, where no doubt they were exceedingly
relieved to find themselves after their disastrous
expedition.</p>
<p>The scare that our squadron had caused extended from St.
David&rsquo;s to Fishguard, all along the coast, in fact, from
which the big vessels could be seen approaching the land.&nbsp;
There were one or two other scares besides this, for our nerves
had been shaken, and our imaginations set going; and truly for
many a long year after the little phrase &ldquo;Look out for the
French!&rdquo; was enough to set women and children off at speed,
and perhaps even to give an uncomfortable qualm in the hearts of
the nobler sex.</p>
<h3><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">INSIDE THE GOLDEN PRISON.</span></h3>
<p>I went at Easter to pay a short visit to two maiden aunts who
lived at Pembroke, where they kept a little millinery&mdash;shop
I had almost said, but that would have vexed their gentle
hearts&mdash;establishment.&nbsp; They were sisters of my mother,
who came from this district, often called &ldquo;Little England
beyond Wales,&rdquo; the people who live there being in fact
Flemings, not Cymri, and the language they speak, being a Saxon
dialect, is worth studying, not from its beauty, but from its
quaintness and originality.&nbsp; Welsh is utterly unknown
&ldquo;down below,&rdquo; as the <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>North Pembrokeshire folks call the
southern half of the county.&nbsp; My mother had great difficulty
in acquiring even a superficial knowledge of Welsh, and she was
always regarded as a stranger in Fishguard, though she lived
there nigh upon fifty years.&nbsp; It was probably my early
acquaintance with English (of a sort) that made my father decide
to bring me up for the ministry.</p>
<p>However, to resume my story&mdash;which was strangely mixed up
with that of the French prisoners&mdash;one of my chief pastimes
during my visit to the worthy spinsters consisted in hanging
about the entrance to the Golden Prison.&nbsp; The foreigners
were allowed to employ their clever fingers in the manufacture of
knick-knacks, made of straw, bones, beads, and other trifles,
which they sold in order to provide themselves with anything they
might require beyond the bare necessaries of life.&nbsp; My good
aunts, Rebecca and <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>Jane Johnson, permitted these articles to be exhibited
on a little table in their show-room, where ladies while idling
away their time in choosing and trying on finery, might perchance
take a fancy to some little object, and bestow some of their
spare cash in helping the poor prisoners.&nbsp; What made my
aunts first think of doing this kindly act was the
representations of their assistant, a pretty young girl named
Eleanor Martin, a daughter of the gaoler of the Golden Prison,
who had had such a sudden accession to his numbers and his
responsibilities.</p>
<p>One day Nellie had occasion to go to the prison with the money
produced by these trifles, and she asked me if I would like to
accompany her and see the Frenchmen at work.&nbsp; My answer may
be readily imagined.&nbsp; So we set forth, and the first person
whom we saw when we reached the limbo of incarcerated bodies, if
not of despairing souls, was <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>not by any means a repulsive object,
being a remarkably pretty young woman, as like Nellie as two peas
are like each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&rsquo;t thee, Fan?&rdquo; asked Nellie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where be feyther?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, remembering her
manners, she added, &ldquo;My sister Frances, Master
Dan&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances and I were speedily friends, in fact, the young woman
saw too many strangers to be troubled by shyness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feyther&rsquo;s main busy, and mustn&rsquo;t be spoke
to,&rdquo; she observed, with rather a knowing look at her
sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the turnkey&rsquo;ll let us in.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a mort easier to get in nor to get out of this old
coop, Mas&rsquo;r Dan&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quite assented to this proposition, but remarked that I
hoped the turnkey would not make any mistake about us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;I was born here
and knows the ways on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that straw for, Frances?&rdquo; I
asked, for I loved to acquire information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Frenchers to make hats of.&nbsp; I brings them
this much most days,&rdquo; she answered, looking down on her big
bundle.</p>
<p>I must really have been growing up lately, for (for the first
time in my life) an instinct of gallantry seized me, and I
offered to carry it for her.&nbsp; She declined in rather a
hurried manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d liefer car&rsquo; it myself, thanking you the
same.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no heft at all, and maybe ye&rsquo;d shed
it about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said I, indignantly, my gallantry
gone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ve never carried a truss
of straw before?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just like a girl.&nbsp; But
what&rsquo;s that in the middle of the bundle?&rdquo; I
continued, eyeing it curiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a
bone, I believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances threw the corner of her apron over the bundle in a
very pettish manner, and to <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>my great surprise grew as red as a
poppy.&nbsp; What was there to blush about in a bone?&nbsp; Nell
struck in hurriedly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course it&rsquo;s a bone, Dan.&nbsp; And what
could they make their buttons and ivory boxes out of but
bone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said, not
liking to suggest &ldquo;ivory&rdquo; for fear, as tempers were
ruffled, they might leave me outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t go for to ax silly questions,&rdquo;
retorted Nell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can us go in, Roche?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, my honies,&rdquo; returned Roche, the turnkey, whom
we had now reached.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leastwise you and Fan can, in
the coorse of natur; but who be this young crut?&rdquo; <a
name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, missus&rsquo; nevvy he be, as wants to see the
Frenchers at work.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only a young boy, but
we&rsquo;d just as lief let him stay if you&rsquo;d liefer not
let him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not feel grateful to my young friend <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>for this
suggestion, which, however, was probably dictated by the wiliness
of woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, take him in there, and leave him if you&rsquo;ve a
mind, my beauty.&nbsp; I reckon one more won&rsquo;t make no odds
in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he seemed to consider a first-class joke, for he guffawed
till we were out of hearing.</p>
<p>After passing through a guard-room, in which there were
several soldiers smoking and lounging about, who offered no
opposition to our passing, Fan and Nell being of course well
known in the prison, we found ourselves in a large and very
dreary hall, paved with flag-stones and almost devoid of
furniture.&nbsp; The inmates, however, seemed pretty cheery on
the whole; there were apparently about a couple of hundred of
them, of whom some were working, some singing, some playing cards
or dominoes&mdash;<i>all</i> talking.&nbsp; Yes, even the singing
ones <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>talked between the verses.&nbsp; The spring sunshine
came through the iron-barred, skied-up windows, and, in spite of
other discouraging circumstances, these children of the South
were (what we never are) gay as larks.</p>
<p>They clustered around my companions with every mark of respect
and admiration.&nbsp; I naturally didn&rsquo;t understand their
jabber, but one remark which was, I rather think, meant for
English, caught my ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zay are&mdash;some angels
out of&mdash;ciel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say you&rsquo;re angels out of the ceiling.&nbsp;
What on earth do they mean?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knows what they mean well enough, don&rsquo;t you
trouble, my honey,&rdquo; answered Nell, who was more friendly to
me than her sister was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Fan had got over her annoyance about the
bone; she still carried the bundle of straw with her apron thrown
over it.</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>We
now went to the part of the room where the men were busy with
their manufactures, and here I had really cause for
astonishment.&nbsp; With no tools except some wretched little
penknives, these skilful-fingered fellows were turning out most
lovely work in bone, wood, and slate.&nbsp; Some of them executed
beautiful mosaic work by letting-in pieces of various coloured
stones on a bed of slate; they afterwards ground and polished the
whole till it resembled the far-famed Florentine mosaic.&nbsp; I
perceived a grindstone in the corner of the room, which the
leniency of the authorities permitted them to have and to
use.</p>
<p>Others of the prisoners were deftly plaiting the straw in many
fanciful devices, these plaits again being rapidly transformed
into hats for men, women, and even dolls.&nbsp; A great many toys
were to be seen in various stages of their formation, wooden
whistles, <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>ships, dolls, windmills, and many other objects of
delight to childhood.</p>
<p>I scanned eagerly the faces of all I saw to discover the
countenances of any of my more particular assailants; but I did
not succeed in recognising one of them.&nbsp; There was such a
remarkable similarity among them, each man was as like his
neighbour as could be; all haggard, all unwashed, all
unshaven.&nbsp; They excited pity, even in a boy&rsquo;s
unsentimental heart; and withal, now that they were not drunk
with greed and brandy, they were so lively and merry.&nbsp; I was
quite sorry I could not understand their jokes.</p>
<p>Fan did not make over her straw to any of these men, as I
fully expected that she would; nor did they seem to expect
it.&nbsp; I heard a great deal of talk about Monsieur le
Commissaire, and there was a good deal of pointing of fingers and
something about &ldquo;chambre voisine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>As
Fanny sheered off I followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I come into the voisin chamber?&rdquo; I
asked, not knowing the meaning of the word, &ldquo;and see
Mounseer the Commissary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fan looked at me in a startled way, but Nell interposed
hastily&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him come, he&rsquo;s main quick and might help;
he&rsquo;s not a cursed boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must explain that in this dialect cursed means malicious or
ill-natured; it has the meaning, in fact, which Shakespeare
followed when he spoke of &ldquo;Kate the curst&rdquo; in his
&ldquo;Taming of the Shrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances looked doubtful, but went on, Nellie and I
following.&nbsp; As we entered the little adjoining room a young
man jumped up, and, running to Nellie, took her hand and kissed
it with much fervour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what d&rsquo;you let that
common fellow kiss your hand for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a common fellow&mdash;he&rsquo;s an <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>engineer!&rdquo; cried Nell, angrily, &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;re nothing but a dull young boy not to know a gentleman
when you sees one!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, mounseer,&rdquo; said I, for Frenchy was
bowing to me, and I wished to show we Welsh knew manners.&nbsp;
But though he might be a gentleman, I still hold to it, he was
grimy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you the money for the things sold in
missus&rsquo; shop,&rdquo; continued Nell; then turning to me,
&ldquo;This gentleman, as is an engineer, is main clever, and
manages all the accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer seemed to me to have been clever enough to have
managed more than accounts; however for once discretion prevailed
and I held my tongue.&nbsp; Then Nellie and this mounseer fell to
their accounts, and seemed to have a great deal to say to each
other in a mixture of French and English, which, not
understanding very well, I found <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>stupid, and turned to look for Fanny
and her friend, another grimy individual, who proved to be the
commissary himself.</p>
<p>They also seemed much taken up with each other, and were
conversing in the same lingo.&nbsp; I noticed that Fan had made
over her bundle of straw to this man, and she seemed very busy
talking over some arrangements.&nbsp; I approached, being willing
to know what it was all about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who ze plague is zis gar&ccedil;on?&rdquo; asked the
commissary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a young boy from down town&mdash;veal,
savez-vous?&nbsp; Nong mauvais&mdash;a smart young chap
obligant.&nbsp; Can portey kelke chose, vous savez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bon!&rdquo; said the Frenchman, letting the word fly
out like a shot, &ldquo;we af some drifles to make car out of
zis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I perceived at once that he had acquired his knowledge of
English from Frances, as &ldquo;car&rdquo; for
&ldquo;carry&rdquo; is pure Pembrokeshire.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to be of use,&rdquo; I
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What sort of things,
Frances&mdash;gimcracks, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat says he, l&agrave;?&rdquo; inquired the
commissary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, gimcracks of a sort&mdash;rather heavy, though, we
find them,&rdquo; said Fan, not stopping to translate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll lend a hand, we&rsquo;d get along
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zey is kep&rsquo; in ze bockat,&rdquo; remarked
Mounseer, luckily indicating some pails in the corner by a
gesture of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adoo, Pierre, I think we&rsquo;d better alley,&rdquo;
remarked Fan.&nbsp; This, I must say, was the sort of French I
liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To nex&rsquo; time, my cabbage!&rdquo; said Pierre.</p>
<p>Then while they were busy over the buckets I turned suddenly
and beheld the engineer bestowing on Nellie an unmistakable
kiss.</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only their foreign ways; like as if we was
to shake hands,&rdquo; cried Nellie, running forward and looking
very rosy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, catch a hoult on these pails,
Dan&rsquo;l; they&rsquo;re main weighty for we maids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did catch hold of a couple of pails, one in each hand, and
found that the last part of Nell&rsquo;s remark was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just feel the heft of un!&rdquo; remarked Fanny.</p>
<p>I did feel it a good deal before I had done with it.&nbsp;
Nellie also carried a pail, and Frances a large bundle, done up
in some old sacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that?&rdquo; I inquired, as we made
our way out of the prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dirty clothes,&rdquo; said Frances, sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They must have some clean linen, I suppose, though they
are Frenchmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to me that they managed to <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>exist
without it, but as the point was not material, and Frances
appeared touchy, I held my tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young boy has giv&rsquo; a hand with the
sweepings, Roche,&rdquo; said Frances, as we passed that
functionary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay?&nbsp; Well, you and Nell be pretty well weighted
too, surely,&rdquo; drawled Roche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gimcracks, and clothes for the wash-&rsquo;us
(house),&rdquo; answered the girl lightly, and in another moment
we were in freedom&mdash;in the open air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor chaps; how good it is!&rdquo; said Nellie,
drawing a long breath.</p>
<p>We went round to a piece of untidy waste land behind the
prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound your arms aches,&rdquo; said
Frances.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drop the buckats, Dan&rsquo;l, and thank
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;drop your gimcracks on this
dirty place&mdash;what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;Oh, never mind what for; don&rsquo;t argufy, my
boy, them&rsquo;s prison sweepings; the gimcracks is in
Nellie&rsquo;s pail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought these were mighty heavy gimcracks.&nbsp;
Well, let me carry Nell&rsquo;s pail to the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Nell, stepping back,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d liefer car my own, don&rsquo;t you
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take your dirty linen,&rdquo; said I,
making a sudden grab at Frances&rsquo; bundle.</p>
<p>To my great surprise some bits of stone and a cloud of mortar
flew out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dan&rsquo;l,&rdquo; said Fan, firmly,
&ldquo;we are greatly beholden for your help, but we don&rsquo;t
want no more at present.&nbsp; You go on with Dan&rsquo;l, Nell,
and leave me here to empt the buckats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nell put down her pail, took my arm, and marched me off.&nbsp;
I was inclined to be offended, but she soothed me down as any <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>woman can
when she chooses.&nbsp; She assured me that both the engineer
(whom she called Jack&mdash;probably Jacques was his name) and
the commissary had taken a great fancy to me, and would undertake
to teach me French if I would only go often enough.</p>
<p>I had not the least objection to going, as I found prison
experiences amusing, but I could not quite understand the
bucket-carrying part of it.</p>
<p>However, neither flattery nor a curiosity stimulus were
unpleasing to me, so I went frequently.</p>
<h3><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AWAY!&nbsp; AWAY!</span></h3>
<p>A couple of weeks passed away thus, when one morning we were
awakened early by a clamour in the street.&nbsp; All Pembroke was
in an uproar.&nbsp; All that I could distinguish of the cries was
one exclamation, &ldquo;The French!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had they broken out, and were they going to sack the
place?&nbsp; The panic reminded me of our feelings at Fishguard
in the spring, but seemed more strange to me now, for in the
interim I had become comparatively intimate with the foreigners,
and had lost my fear of them.&nbsp; I jumped out of bed, dragged
<a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>on a
garment or two, and flung open my little lattice window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the French?&rdquo; I yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away, away!&rdquo; came the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clean
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea occurred to me that if they had gone away clean they
must have been in a very different state to their usual
condition; however, my reflections were disturbed by the sudden
appearance of my Aunt Jane; she burst in head foremost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Eleanor?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the French?&rdquo; I answered lightly,
&ldquo;Away, away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye curs&euml;d, boy, or only dull?&rdquo; <a
name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223"
class="citation">[223]</a> queried my angry relative.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;only I know no more
about Nell than I do about the French.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t she in
the shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>&ldquo;In the shop!&nbsp; My patience&mdash;she
isn&rsquo;t in the house, nor hasn&rsquo;t been for hours.&nbsp;
Her bed is cold; I doubt she never got into un, only
topsy-turvied un a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie really gone!&rdquo; I was beginning to grasp the
situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Jane; she must have gone with
Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Jack, name o&rsquo; fortune?&nbsp; I heard
tell of a Billy and a Tommy, but norra Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this wasn&rsquo;t a Pembroke Jack, but Mounseer
Jacques Roux, Esq., an engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Mounseer!&rdquo;&nbsp; Words failed my venerable
relative; she sat down and went off into hysterics, which brought
Aunt Rebecca to the rescue, and in the confusion I sidled down
the stairs and escaped.</p>
<p>I made my way through the crowd to the Golden Prison, and here
a light dawned, and many things became clear to me.&nbsp; A crowd
of people were standing at what appeared to me to be a hole in
the ground, about sixty <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>yards from the wall of the
prison.&nbsp; I edged myself through the lookers-on till I had
reached the hole; it was one end of a subterranean passage, the
other end of which doubtless emerged&mdash;but a sick qualm came
over me, and to make matters worse at this moment I
espied&mdash;and was seen by&mdash;Roche the turnkey.&nbsp; He
was looking very small, but assumed an air of bluster when he
perceived me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest that young chap there,&rdquo; he ordered his
assistants.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a helping o&rsquo; they sneaking
scoundrels; I see un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment the two men had me in tow, and being also
propelled by the crowd in a few minutes, I found myself inside
the Golden Prison.&nbsp; I did not find the place at all
entertaining this time.&nbsp; However, there were some
magistrates there, and one of them, a Dr. Mansell, ordered the
men to loose their hold while he questioned me.</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>I
told all I knew, and at the end was relieved, but mortified to
hear him say, &ldquo;There is no occasion to detain him, the boy
evidently knew nothing about it.&nbsp; He was a young ass, but he
is not the first of us who has been befooled by a
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this there was a general guffaw in which I tried to join,
but I felt as small as Roche the turnkey.&nbsp; It appeared that
all those pails and bundles had been full of earth, stones, and
mortar, which the men had scraped out in making the tunnel.&nbsp;
I went into the little inner room, and there in the floor, just
behind where Pierre Lebrun used to sit, surrounded with bundles
of straw, blocks of wood, etc., was the other end of the
subterranean passage.&nbsp; They had absolutely scratched through
the thick wall of the prison, and then grubbed like moles through
sixty yards of earth, with no other implement than the bones of
horses&rsquo; legs.</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>I did
not care for the remarks of the bystanders, and I got out of that
gaol as quickly as I could, but not before Dr. Mansell had asked
me another question or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear Frances Martin has absconded,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you tell me anything about Eleanor?&nbsp;
She lives with your aunts, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not to be found, sir,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is off with Jack, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mounseer Jacques Roux, the engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the fellow who managed the tunnelling.&nbsp; Why do
you pitch upon him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;she did, because he used to kiss
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss!&nbsp; By George, didn&rsquo;t that rouse your
suspicions?&rdquo; cried the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, they said it was the French way of shaking
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along, softy!&rdquo; cried the crowd, and I <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>went.&nbsp;
But as I went I heard the stentorian voice of Dr. Mansell
proclaim&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred guineas reward for the recovery of those
two young women, dead or alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few hours handbills to this effect were posted all over
the place, and, as soon as practicable, in every town in the
kingdom; by which the names of Frances Martin and Eleanor Martin
must have become well known.&nbsp; Whenever I saw one of these
placards it seemed to me as if I had had something to do with a
great crime, and that part of the five hundred guineas would
perhaps be given for my body some day&mdash;dead or alive.</p>
<p>I walked down to the shore to a little port on the outside of
the town, the very place to which I had been on the previous
Sunday with Nell.&nbsp; I remembered, with another qualm, the
interest which she had taken in <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>the shipping, and how she had even
begged me to ask some questions of the sailors, who, as usual,
lounged about where they could smell tar.&nbsp; She said it was
awkward for a girl to talk to these rough fellows, but that it
was a pleasant variety for a young man.&nbsp; So, of course, I
asked all the questions she desired about incoming sloops.&nbsp;
I, thinking these questions referred to some sailor sweetheart,
took no account of the matter at all.&nbsp; As we looked and
talked we perceived a sloop in the offing coming in.&nbsp; The
men said she would be in shortly, and that she was bringing culm
for the use of Lord Cawdor&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p>Nellie seemed very pleased and happy as she watched the sloop
coming rapidly nearer, a brisk breeze from the south filling her
sails and urging her onwards.&nbsp; The only boat actually in the
harbour was Lord Cawdor&rsquo;s yacht.</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>His
lordship&rsquo;s yacht was now nowhere to be seen; the sloop was
still there, for owing to the breeze and the sailors&rsquo; hurry
to get ashore on Sunday, they had run her aground, and there she
was hard and fast, but not in the same state as on Sunday.&nbsp;
A hundred Frenchmen had made their escape, creeping through their
tunnel and jumping out at the other end like so many
jack-in-the-boxes.&nbsp; Some of the fugitives made at once for
the yacht, some for the sloop, which, to their great
disappointment, they found aground.&nbsp; They boarded it, lashed
the sailors&rsquo; hands and feet (these men now recounted the
story, each man to a listening crowd, which we must hope was a
slight solace for their sufferings)&mdash;they took compass,
water casks, and every scrap of food and clothing they could
find; then conveyed them aboard the yacht which they launched,
and off they were.&nbsp; The tied-up sailors had seen nothing of
any <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>women, but between darkness and surprise it was a
wonder they had noted as much as they had.</p>
<p>This was all that we could gather at the time; it was only
enough to make us very uncomfortable about the fate of the two
rash girls.&nbsp; My position was not made more comfortable by
the constant reproaches of my two old aunts, who seemed to think
me in some way responsible for Nell&rsquo;s escapade.&nbsp;
Altogether I was not sorry that it was decided to send me back at
once to St. David&rsquo;s; school was better than scorn.&nbsp;
But the very night before I left Pembroke, my uncomfortable
feelings were doomed to be deepened.&nbsp; The stern of the yacht
was washed ashore with other timbers, on one of which his
lordship&rsquo;s name was inscribed.&nbsp; There could be little
doubt of the fate of those on board.&nbsp; The weather had been
rough and foggy, and these French soldiers <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>were
probably little skilled in navigation.&nbsp; So I departed to St.
David&rsquo;s with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Some weeks passed in the usual course of classics and
mathematics rammed in by main force, when one day there came a
letter to me in Aunt Jane&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp; I was
surprised, for my aunts were not given to composition; but on
opening the envelope I found Aunt Jane had
written&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; She had merely enclosed, oh, greater
surprise, a foreign letter.&nbsp; I had never had, and never
expected to have, a foreign correspondent.&nbsp; What language
would he write in&mdash;a quick hope flashed through me that it
might not be Latin, any other I would give up quietly.</p>
<p>I opened the letter and perceived it was in English.&nbsp; It
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mastr
Danl</span>,&mdash;I hope as this finds you well as it leaves me
at present.&nbsp; <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>You was main good to we, so I pens this line to say as
I am no longer Eleanor Martin but Madam Roux.&nbsp; [Oh
joy!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t care what her name was as long as she
wasn&rsquo;t drowned.] Yes, me and Jack have married, only he
likes it writ Jacques which is a mort of trouble.&nbsp;
Howsomever we gets along lovely so likewise do Frances and her
young man Peter which were a commisser and she is now Madam
Lebrun.&nbsp; We did a main lot for they lads&mdash;which they
was grateful.&nbsp; Praps you&rsquo;d like to hear that after we
got safe away in his ludship&rsquo;s yat, after you&rsquo;d
kindly helpd we to burrow out o jail, we come in for three days
fog.&nbsp; Short commons there was till we overtook a brig, gave
out as we was shiprackt and was took aboord, Fan and me dressed
as lads.&nbsp; That night we was too many for the crew of the
brig, as nocked under and us made them steer for France, so here
we be.&nbsp; The brig had corn aboord, so <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>we wasnt
clemmed.&nbsp; We let the yat go.&nbsp; Hoping to see you soon, I
remains,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your humbel servant to
command,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nellie</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her ending wish was granted some years after, when peace was
settled between England and France.&nbsp; Nellie and her husband,
the engineer, came back to Wales and settled for a time in
Merthyr, where they opened a large inn, he following his
profession in the mines, both he and his wife roasting me
unmercifully when I went to stay with them (a full-fledged
curate), on the assistance I had once rendered to the French
prisoners in a mining operation; but I hope all will understand
that this assistance was unintentional on my part, and that I
greatly condemn the unpatriotic conduct of the sisters.</p>

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
